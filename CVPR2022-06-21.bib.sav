In this work, we explore how to extend self-attention modules to better learn subtle feature embeddings for recognizing fine-grained objects, e.g., different bird species or person identities. To this end, we propose a dual cross-attention learning (DCAL) algorithm to coordinate with self-attention learning. First, we propose global-local cross-attention (GLCA) to enhance the interactions between global images and local high-response regions, which can help reinforce the spatial-wise discriminative clues for recognition. Second, we propose pair-wise cross-attention (PWCA) to establish the interactions between image pairs. PWCA can regularize the attention learning of an image by treating another image as distractor and will be removed during inference. We observe that DCAL can reduce misleading attentions and diffuse the attention response to discover more complementary parts for recognition. We conduct extensive evaluations on fine-grained visual categorization and object re-identification. Experiments demonstrate that DCAL performs on par with state-of-the-art methods and consistently improves multiple self-attention baselines, e.g., surpassing DeiT-Tiny and ViT-Base by 2.8% and 2.4% mAP on MSMT17, respectively.}}

Different from previous studies using contrastive learning, we tackle the issue from an alternative perspective, i.e., by formulating the representation learning scheme in a generative manner. Typically, the neighboring image patches among one text line tend to have similar styles, including the strokes, textures, colors, etc. Motivated by this common sense, we augment one image patch and use its neighboring patch as guidance to recover itself. Specifically, we propose a Similarity-Aware Normalization (SimAN) module to identify the different patterns and align the corresponding styles from the guiding patch. In this way, the network gains representation capability for distinguishing complex patterns such as messy strokes and cluttered backgrounds. Experiments show that the proposed SimAN significantly improves the representation quality and achieves promising performance. Moreover, we surprisingly find that our self-supervised generative network has impressive potential for data synthesis, text image editing, and font interpolation, which suggests that the proposed SimAN has a wide range of practical applications.}}

Guided by two intuitive priors, our method is executed across different views and within per single view of an image, aiming to impose cross-view feature semantic consistency regularization and facilitate intra(inter)-class compactness(dispersion) of the feature space. Our method can be seamlessly incorporated into existing WSSS models without any changes to the base networks and does not incur any extra inference burden. Extensive experiments manifest that our method consistently improves two strong baselines by large margins, demonstrating the effectiveness. Specifically, built on top of SEAM, we improve the initial seed mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 from 55.4% to 61.5%.

Specifically, we focus on the animation of fluid elements like water, smoke, fire, which have the properties of repeating textures and continuous fluid motion. Taking inspiration from prior works, we represent the motion of such fluid elements in the image in the form of a constant 2D optical flow map. To this end, we allow the user to provide any number of arrow directions and their associated speeds along with a mask of the regions the user wants to animate. The user-provided input arrow directions, their corresponding speed values, and the mask are then converted into a dense flow map representing a constant optical flow map (F_D). We observe that F_D, obtained using simple exponential operations can closely approximate the plausible motion of elements in the image. We further refine computed dense optical flow map F_D using a generative-adversarial network (GAN) to obtain a more realistic flow map. We devise a novel UNet based architecture to autoregressively generate future frames using the refined optical flow map by forward-warping the input image features at different resolutions. We conduct extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset and show that our method is superior to the baselines in terms of qualitative and quantitative metrics. In addition, we show the qualitative animations of the objects in directions that did not exist in the training set and provide a way to synthesize videos that otherwise would not exist in the real world.

In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of constant size. Specifically, we explicitly generate and update RDE by the proposed Spatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which exploits the cue of historical information. To avoid error accumulation owing to the recurrent usage of SAM, we propose an unbiased guidance loss during the training stage, which makes SAM more robust in long videos. Moreover, the predicted masks in the memory bank are inaccurate due to the inaccurate network inference, which affects the segmentation of the query frame. To address this problem, we design a novel self-correction strategy so that the network can repair the embeddings of masks with different qualities in the memory bank. Extensive experiments show our method achieves the best tradeoff between performance and speed.}}

However, such hierarchical reasoning ability of human perception remains largely unexplored in current literature of semantic segmentation. Existing work is often aware of flatten labels and predicts target classes exclusively for each pixel. In this paper, we instead address hierarchical semantic segmentation (HSS), which aims at structured, pixel-wise description of visual observation in terms of a class hierarchy. We devise HSSN, a general HSS framework that tackles two critical issues in this task: i) how to efficiently adapt existing hierarchy-agnostic segmentation networks to the HSS setting, and ii) how to leverage the hierarchy information to regularize HSS network learning. To address i), HSSN directly casts HSS as a pixel-wise multi-label classification task, only bringing minimal architecture change to current segmentation models. To solve ii), HSSN first explores inherent properties of the hierarchy as a training objective, which enforces segmentation predictions to obey the hierarchy structure. Further, with hierarchy-induced margin constraints, HSSN reshapes the pixel embedding space, so as to generate well-structured pixel representations and improve segmentation eventually. We conduct experiments on four semantic segmentation datasets (i.e., Mapillary Vistas 2.0, Cityscapes, LIP, and PASCAL-Person-Part), with different class hierarchies, segmentation network architectures and backbones, showing the generalization and superiority of HSSN.}}

In contrast to previous works, this paper proposes a new SfT approach explaining 2D observations through physical simulations accounting for forces and material properties. Our differentiable physics simulator regularises the surface evolution and optimises the material elastic properties such as bending coefficients, stretching stiffness and density. We use a differentiable renderer to minimise the dense reprojection error between the estimated 3D states and the input images and recover the deformation parameters using an adaptive gradient-based optimisation. For the evaluation, we record with an RGB-D camera challenging real surfaces exposed to physical forces with various material properties and textures. Our approach significantly reduces the 3D reconstruction error compared to multiple competing methods. For the source code and data, see https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/phi-SfT/.}}

But do attribute-specific learned representations of data also respect the same causal relations? We answer this question in three steps. First, we introduce NCINet, an approach for observational causal discovery from high-dimensional data. It is trained purely on synthetically generated representations and can be applied to real representations, and is specifically designed to mitigate the domain gap between the two. Second, we apply NCINet to identify the causal relations between image representations of different pairs of attributes with known and unknown causal relations between the labels. For this purpose, we consider image representations learned for predicting attributes on the 3D Shapes, CelebA, and the CASIA-WebFace datasets, which we annotate with multiple multi-class attributes. Third, we analyze the effect on the underlying causal relation between learned representations induced by various design choices in representation learning. Our experiments indicate that (1) NCINet significantly outperforms existing observational causal discovery approaches for estimating the causal relation between pairs of random samples, both in the presence and absence of an unobserved confounder, (2) under controlled scenarios, learned representations can indeed satisfy the underlying causal relations between their respective labels, and (3) the causal relations are positively correlated with the predictive capability of the representations.

To this end, we propose a Multi-class Token Transformer, termed as MCTformer, which uses multiple class tokens to learn interactions between the class tokens and the patch tokens. The proposed MCTformer can successfully produce class-discriminative object localization maps from the class-to-patch attentions corresponding to different class tokens. We also propose to use a patch-level pairwise affinity, which is extracted from the patch-to-patch transformer attention, to further refine the localization maps. Moreover, the proposed framework is shown to fully complement the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method, leading to remarkably superior WSSS results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. These results underline the importance of the class token for WSSS.}}

Meanwhile, supervised denoisers trained on synthetic data perform poorly in practice. Self-supervised denoisers, which learn only from single noisy images, solve the data collection problem. However, self-supervised denoising methods, especially blindspot-driven ones, suffer sizable information loss during input or network design. The absence of valuable information dramatically reduces the upper bound of denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach called Blind2Unblind to overcome the information loss in blindspot-driven denoising methods. First, we introduce a global-aware mask mapper that enables global perception and accelerates training. The mask mapper samples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same channel, allowing the loss function to optimize all blind spots at once. Second, we propose a re-visible loss to train the denoising network and make blind spots visible. The denoiser can learn directly from raw noise images without losing information or being trapped in identity mapping. We also theoretically analyze the convergence of the re-visible loss. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work.

This suggests a new desired property we call object-level rotation equivariance. To incorporate object-level rotation equivariance into 3D object detectors, we need a mechanism to extract equivariant features with local object-level spatial support while being able to model cross-object context information.

First, it projects object queries into the same embedding space as encoded image features, where the matching can be accomplished efficiently with aligned semantics. Second, it explicitly searches salient points with the most discriminative features for semantic-aligned matching, which further speeds up the convergence and boosts detection accuracy as well.

To address this, in this work, an automatic approach is proposed to directly clone the whole outfits from real-world person images to virtual 3D characters, such that any virtual person thus created will appear very similar to its real-world counterpart. Specifically, based on UV texture mapping, two cloning methods are designed, namely registered clothes mapping and homogeneous cloth expansion. Given clothes keypoints detected on person images and labeled on regular UV maps with clear clothes structures, registered mapping applies perspective homography to warp real-world clothes to the counterparts on the UV map. As for invisible clothes parts and irregular UV maps, homogeneous expansion segments a homogeneous area on clothes as a realistic cloth pattern or cell, and expand the cell to fill the UV map. Furthermore, a similarity-diversity expansion strategy is proposed, by clustering person images, sampling images per cluster, and cloning outfits for 3D character generation. This way, virtual persons can be scaled up densely in visual similarity to challenge model learning, and diversely in population to enrich sample distribution. Finally, by rendering the cloned characters in Unity3D scenes, a more realistic virtual dataset called ClonedPerson is created, with 5,621 identities and 887,766 images. Experimental results show that the model trained on ClonedPerson has a better generalization performance, superior to that trained on other popular real-world and synthetic person re-identification datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to remove eyeglasses as well as their cast shadows from face images. The method works in a detect-then-remove manner, in which eyeglasses and cast shadows are both detected and then removed from images. Due to the lack of paired data for supervised training, we present a new synthetic portrait dataset with both intermediate and final supervisions for both the detection and removal tasks. Furthermore, we apply a cross-domain technique to fill the gap between the synthetic and real data. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed technique is the first to remove eyeglasses and their cast shadows simultaneously.

In this paper, we propose a novel Cross Language Image Matching (CLIMS) framework, based on the recently introduced Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, for WSSS. The core idea of our framework is to introduce natural language supervision to activate more complete object regions and suppress closely-related open background regions. In particular, we design object, background region and text label matching losses to guide the model to excite more reasonable object regions for CAM of each category. In addition, we design a co-occurring background suppression loss to prevent the model from activating closely-related background regions, with a predefined set of class-related background text descriptions. These designs enable the proposed CLIMS to generate a more complete and compact activation map for the target objects.

Based on hard-label classification, existing RecogTrans approaches suffer from noisy supervision signals in pre-training. To mitigate this problem, we developed TransRank, a unified framework for recognizing Transformations in a Ranking formulation. TransRank provides accurate supervision signals by recognizing transformations relatively, consistently outperforming the classification-based formulation. Meanwhile, the unified framework can be instantiated with an arbitrary set of temporal or spatial transformations, demonstrating good generality. With a ranking-based formulation and several empirical practices, we achieve competitive performance on video retrieval and action recognition.Under the same setting, TransRank surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by 6.4% on UCF101 and 8.3% on HMDB51 for action recognition (Top1 Acc); improves video retrieval on UCF101 by 20.4% (R@1).

At its core is understanding the alignments between visual scenes in video and linguistic semantics in question to yield the answer. In leading VideoQA models, the typical learning objective, empirical risk minimization (ERM), latches on superficial correlations between video-question pairs and answers as the alignments. However, ERM can be problematic, because it tends to over-exploit the spurious correlations between question-irrelevant scenes and answers, instead of inspecting the causal effect of question-critical scenes. As a result, the VideoQA models suffer from unreliable reasoning. In this work, we first take a causal look at VideoQA and argue that invariant grounding is the key to ruling out the spurious correlations. Towards this end, we propose a new learning framework, Invariant Grounding for VideoQA (IGV), to ground the question-critical scene, whose causal relations with answers are invariant across different interventions on the complement. With IGV, the VideoQA models are forced to shield the answering process from the negative influence of spurious correlations, which significantly improves the reasoning ability.

As another powerful generative approach, autoregressive (AR) model has not been noticed in low level tasks due to its limitation.

In particular, for the noisy 1-bit measurement model, we show that our non-iterative method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art iterative method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.}}

To solve this "partial" problem, we advocate for a simple set-based approach using optimal transport (OT) to model cross-modal region associativity in a partially-aware fashion. Importantly, we improve upon OT to further account for holistic partialness by comparing intra-modal adjacency matrices. Our proposed method is not only robust to partial scene-sketches but also yields state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.}}

Specifically, we propose to encode local geometry and density with three embeddings: density embedding, local position embedding and ancestor embedding. During the decoding, we explicitly predict the upsampling factor for each point, and the directions and scales of the upsampled points. To mitigate the clustered points issue in existing methods, we design a novel sub-point convolution layer, and an upsampling block with adaptive scale. Furthermore, our method can also compress point-wise attributes, such as normal. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on SemanticKITTI and ShapeNet demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art rate-distortion trade-off.}}

Under this circumstance, we successfully transfer the boundary detection task into the change point detection based on the similarity. Then, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is conducted in local windows to select the smallest points as candidate boundaries. In addition, a clustering algorithm is followed to refine the initial proposals. Moreover, we also extend ABD to the online setting, which enables real-time action segmentation in long untrimmed videos.

Current CNN-based methods do not support such high resolutions due to limited GPU memory.

We project the 360deg input image onto a set of tangent planes that produce perspective views, which are suitable for the latest, most accurate state-of-the-art perspective monocular depth estimators. To achieve globally consistent disparity estimates, we recombine the individual depth estimates using deformable multi-scale alignment followed by gradient-domain blending. The result is a dense, high-resolution 360deg depth map with a high level of detail, also for outdoor scenes which are not supported by existing methods.

In its Macro stage, the model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the underlying environment and the agent movements, to predict the long and short term motion goals.

Existing works for this task heavily rely on 2D representations (e.g. appearance and motion) learned from the input images. However, dense 3D facial geometry (e.g. pixel-wise depth) is extremely important for this task as it is particularly beneficial for us to essentially generate accurate 3D face structures and distinguish noisy information from the possibly cluttered background. Nevertheless, dense 3D geometry annotations are prohibitively costly for videos and are typically not available for this video generation task. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised face-depth learning method to automatically recover dense 3D facial geometry (i.e. depth) from the face videos without the requirement of any expensive 3D annotation data. Based on the learned dense depth maps, we further propose to leverage them to estimate sparse facial keypoints that capture the critical movement of the human head. In a more dense way, the depth is also utilized to learn 3D-aware cross-modal (i.e. appearance and depth) attention to guide the generation of motion fields for warping source image representations. All these contributions compose a novel depth-aware generative adversarial network (DaGAN) for talking head generation. Extensive experiments conducted demonstrate that our proposed method can generate highly realistic faces, and achieve significant results on the unseen human faces.}}

However, HNNs underperform ENNs on standard benchmarks without clear hierarchies, greatly restricting HNNs' applicability in practice. Our key insight is that HNNs' poorer general classification performance results from vanishing gradients during backpropagation, caused by their hybrid architecture connecting Euclidean features to a hyperbolic classifier. We propose an effective solution by simply clipping the Euclidean feature magnitude while training HNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that clipped HNNs become super-hyperbolic classifiers: They are not only consistently better than HNNs which already outperform ENNs on hierarchical data, but also on-par with ENNs on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, with better adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution detection.}}

To tackle this, we firstly propose to formulate the combinatorial problem of graph matching as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, which is more flexible and efficient to facilitate comparing graphs of varied sizes. A novel Graph-context Attention Network (GCAN), which jointly capture intrinsic graph structure and cross-graph information for improving the discrimination of node features, is then proposed and trained to resolve this ILP problem with node correspondence supervision. We further show that the proposed GCAN model is efficient to resolve the graph-level matching problem and is able to automatically learn node-to-node similarity via graph-level matching. The proposed approach is evaluated on three public keypoint-matching datasets and one graph-matching dataset for blood vessel patterns, with experimental results showing its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on the keypoint and graph-level matching tasks.}}

By considering instance contrastive learning as a dictionary look-up operation, we construct a semantics-aware dictionary with samples from both source and target domains where each target sample is assigned a (pseudo) category label based on the category priors of source samples. This allows category contrastive learning (between target queries and the category-level dictionary) for category-discriminative yet domain-invariant feature representations: samples of the same category (from either source or target domain) are pulled closer while those of different categories are pushed apart simultaneously. Extensive UDA experiments in multiple visual tasks (e.g., segmentation, classification and detection) show that CaCo achieves superior performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods. The experiments also demonstrate that CaCo is complementary to existing UDA methods and generalizable to other learning setups such as unsupervised model adaptation, open-/partial-set adaptation etc.}}

We suggest that the models over-rely on the visual context, i.e., irrelevant objects in the image, to make predictions. To diagnose the models' reliance on visual context and measure their robustness, we propose a simple yet effective perturbation technique, SwapMix. SwapMix perturbs the visual context by swapping features of irrelevant context objects with features from other objects in the dataset. Using SwapMix we are able to change answers to more than 45% of the questions for a representative VQA model. Additionally, we train the models with perfect sight and find that the context over-reliance highly depends on the quality of visual representations. In addition to diagnosing, SwapMix can also be applied as a data augmentation strategy during training in order to regularize the context over-reliance. By swapping the context object features, the model reliance on context can be suppressed effectively. Two representative VQA models are studied using SwapMix: a co-attention model MCAN and a large-scale pretrained model LXMERT. Our experiments on the popular GQA dataset show the effectiveness of SwapMix for both diagnosing model robustness, and regularizing the over-reliance on visual context.}}

In these settings, spectral coordinates have shown promise for shape representation due to their ability to incorporate both local and global shape properties in a manner that is qualitatively invariant to isometric transformations. Yet, surprisingly, such coordinates have thus far typically considered only local surface positional or derivative information. In the present article, we propose to equip spectral coordinates with medial (object width) information, so as to enrich them. The key idea is to couple surface points that share a medial ball, via the weights of the adjacency matrix. We develop a spectral feature using this idea, and the algorithms to compute it.

Rather than directly refining 2D image appearance, L2R learns to recover fine-grained 3D details on the proxy against degradation via extracting generative facial priors. Concretely, L2R proposes a novel albedo restoration network to model high-quality 3D facial texture, in which the diverse guidance from the pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is leveraged to complement the lack of input facial clues. With the finer details of the restored 3D texture, L2R then learns displacement maps from scratch to enhance the significant facial structure and geometry. Both of the procedures are mutually optimized with a novel 3D-aware adversarial loss, which further improves the modelling performance and suppresses the potential uncertainty. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that L2R outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the condition of low-quality inputs, and obtains superior performances than 2D pre-processed modelling approaches with limited 3D proxy.}}

Hence, in this paper, we introduce adapter-based parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques to V&L models such as VL-BART and VL-T5. We evaluate our methods in a unified multi-task setup on both image-text and video-text benchmarks. For the image-text tasks, we use four diverse V&L datasets: VQAv2, GQA, NLVR2, and MSCOCO image captioning. For video-text tasks, we use TVQA, How2QA, TVC, and YC2C. With careful training and thorough experiments, we benchmark three popular adapter-based methods (Adapter, Hyperformer, Compacter) against the standard full fine-tuning and the recently proposed prompt-tuning approach. We also enhance the efficiency and performance of adapters by sharing their weights to attain knowledge across tasks. Our results demonstrate that training the adapter with the weight-sharing technique (4.18% of total parameters for image-text tasks and 3.39% for video-text tasks) can match the performance of fine-tuning the entire model. Lastly, we present a comprehensive analysis including the combination of adapter and task-specific prompts and the impact of V&L pre-training on adapters.}}

However, object detection is much more sophisticated and most knowledge distillation methods have failed on it. In this paper, we point out that in object detection, the features of the teacher and student vary greatly in different areas, especially in the foreground and background. If we distill them equally, the uneven differences between feature maps will negatively affect the distillation. Thus, we propose Focal and Global Distillation (FGD). Focal distillation separates the foreground and background, forcing the student to focus on the teacher's critical pixels and channels. Global distillation rebuilds the relation between different pixels and transfers it from teachers to students, compensating for missing global information in focal distillation. As our method only needs to calculate the loss on the feature map, FGD can be applied to various detectors. We experiment on various detectors with different backbones and the results show that the student detector achieves excellent mAP improvement. For example, ResNet-50 based RetinaNet, Faster RCNN, RepPoints and Mask RCNN with our distillation method achieve 40.7%, 42.0%, 42.0% and 42.1% mAP on COCO2017, which are 3.3, 3.6, 3.4 and 2.9 higher than the baseline, respectively.

However, the richness of data comes at the expense of fundamental challenges such as abrupt shot changes and close up shots of actors with heavy truncation, which limits the applicability of existing 3D human understanding methods. In this paper, we address these limitations with the insight that while shot changes of the same scene incur a discontinuity between frames, the 3D structure of the scene still changes smoothly. This allows us to handle frames before and after the shot change as multi-view signal that provide strong cues to recover the 3D state of the actors. We propose a multi-shot optimization framework that realizes this insight, leading to improved 3D reconstruction and mining of sequences with pseudo-ground truth 3D human mesh. We treat this data as valuable supervision for models that enable human mesh recovery from movies; both from single image and from video, where we propose a transformer-based temporal encoder that can naturally handle missing observations due to shot changes in the input frames. We demonstrate the importance of our insight and proposed models through extensive experiments.

To address this, we propose a GAN-based approach that generates images conditioned on latent masks, thereby alleviating full or weak annotations required in previous approaches. We show that such mask-conditioned image generation can be learned faithfully when conditioning the masks in a hierarchical manner on latent keypoints that define the position of parts explicitly. Without requiring supervision of masks or points, this strategy increases robustness to viewpoint and object positions changes. It also lets us generate image-mask pairs for training a segmentation network, which outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods on established benchmarks.}}

But CNNs usually do not take the topology of the results into account, and often require a large amount of annotations for training. We integrate CNNs into the minimal path method, so that both techniques benefit from each other: CNNs employ learned image features to improve the determination of minimal paths, while the minimal path method ensures the correct topology of the segmented centerlines, provides strong geometric priors to increase the performance of CNNs, and reduces the amount of annotations for the training of CNNs significantly. Our method has lower hardware requirements than many recent methods. Qualitative and quantitative comparison with other methods shows that Path-CNN achieves better performance, especially when dealing with tubular structures with complex shapes in challenging environments.}}

Nevertheless, despite the increasing level of detail in the 3D face reconstructions from single images mainly attributed to deep learning advances, finer and highly deformable components of the face such as the tongue are still absent from all 3D face models in the literature, although being very important for the realness of the 3D avatar representations.

Data is thus a bottleneck for training effective sign language translation models. To mitigate this problem, we propose to progressively pretrain the model from general-domain datasets that include a large amount of external supervision to within-domain datasets. Concretely, we pretrain the sign-to-gloss visual network on the general domain of human actions and the within-domain of a sign-to-gloss dataset, and pretrain the gloss-to-text translation network on the general domain of a multilingual corpus and the within-domain of a gloss-to-text corpus. The joint model is fine-tuned with an additional module named the visual-language mapper that connects the two networks. This simple baseline surpasses the previous state-of-the-art results on two sign language translation benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning.

Its core is a differentiable optimisation layer that operates on a learned affinity graph. The learned graph potentials make it possible to leverage rich contextual information from the guide image, while the explicit graph optimisation within the architecture guarantees rigorous fidelity of the high-resolution target to the low-resolution source. With the decision to employ the source as a constraint rather than only as an input to the prediction, our method differs from state-of-the-art deep architectures for guided super-resolution, which produce targets that, when downsampled, will only approximately reproduce the source. This is not only theoretically appealing, but also produces crisper, more natural-looking images. A key property of our method is that, although the graph connectivity is restricted to the pixel lattice, the associated edge potentials are learned with a deep feature extractor and can encode rich context information over large receptive fields. By taking advantage of the sparse graph connectivity, it becomes possible to propagate gradients through the optimisation layer and learn the edge potentials from data. We extensively evaluate our method on several datasets, and consistently outperform recent baselines in terms of quantitative reconstruction errors, while also delivering visually sharper outputs.

To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to exploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key features of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational Attention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature map from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations across semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these panoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to focus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of instances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general module that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture. Through extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable improvements over existing approaches.}}

Besides, the large-scale training data inevitably suffers from inter-class conflict and long-tailed distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparsely updating variant of the FC layer, named Partial FC (PFC). In each iteration, positive class centers and a random subset of negative class centers are selected to compute the margin-based softmax loss. All class centers are still maintained throughout the whole training process, but only a subset is selected and updated in each iteration. Therefore, the computing requirement, the probability of inter-class conflict, and the frequency of passive update on tail class centers, are dramatically reduced. Extensive experiments across different training data and backbones (e.g. CNN and ViT) confirm the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed PFC.}}

The benefit of the inductive bias the network imposes in the DIP framework depends on the architecture. Therefore, researchers have studied how to automate the search to determine the best-performing model. However, common neural architecture search (NAS) techniques are resource and time-intensive. Moreover, best-performing models are determined for a whole dataset of images instead of for each image independently, which would be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first show that optimal neural architectures in the DIP framework are image-dependent. Leveraging this insight, we then propose an image-specific NAS strategy for the DIP framework that requires substantially less training than typical NAS approaches, effectively enabling image-specific NAS. We justify the proposed strategy's effectiveness by (1) demonstrating its performance on a NAS Dataset for DIP that includes 522 models from a particular search space (2) conducting extensive experiments on image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our experiments show that image-specific metrics can reduce the search space to a small cohort of models, of which the best model outperforms current NAS approaches for image restoration.

Due to the complex nature of this multimodal task, which combines text reasoning, video understanding, instance segmentation and tracking, existing approaches typically rely on sophisticated pipelines in order to tackle it. In this paper, we propose a simple Transformer-based approach to RVOS. Our framework, termed Multimodal Tracking Transformer (MTTR), models the RVOS task as a sequence prediction problem. Following recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, MTTR is based on the realization that video and text can be processed together effectively and elegantly by a single multimodal Transformer model. MTTR is end-to-end trainable, free of text-related inductive bias components and requires no additional mask-refinement post-processing steps. As such, it simplifies the RVOS pipeline considerably compared to existing methods. Evaluation on standard benchmarks reveals that MTTR significantly outperforms previous art across multiple metrics. In particular, MTTR shows impressive +5.7 and +5.0 mAP gains on the A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences datasets respectively, while processing 76 frames per second. In addition, we report strong results on the public validation set of Refer-YouTube-VOS, a more challenging RVOS dataset that has yet to receive the attention of researchers.

It is challenging due to the complexity of the task and the absence of paired data. The core idea of the proposed method is to introduce gated cycle mapping, that utilizes a novel gated mapping unit to produce the category-specific style code and embeds this code into cycle networks to control the translation process. For the concept of category, we classify images into different categories (e.g., 4 types: photo/cartoon portrait/scene) and learn finer-grained category translations rather than overall mappings between two domains (e.g., photo and cartoon). Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily extended to cartoon video generation with an auxiliary dataset and a new adaptive style loss. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state of the art and validate its effectiveness in the brand-new task of general cartoon image synthesis.}}

We then introduce the frequency domain as an additional clue to better detect camouflaged objects from backgrounds. To well involve the frequency clues into the CNN models, we present a powerful network with two special components. We first design a novel frequency enhancement module (FEM) to dig clues of camouflaged objects in the frequency domain. It contains the offline discrete cosine transform followed by the learnable enhancement. Then we use a feature alignment to fuse the features from RGB domain and frequency domain. Moreover, to further make full use of the frequency information, we propose the high-order relation module (HOR) to handle the rich fusion feature.

Prior methods typically adopt a local appearance flow estimation model. They are thus intrinsically susceptible to difficult body poses/occlusions and large mis-alignments between person and garment images. To overcome this limitation, a novel global appearance flow estimation model is proposed in this work. For the first time, a StyleGAN based architecture is adopted for appearance flow estimation. This enables us to take advantage of a global style vector to encode a whole-image context to cope with the aforementioned challenges. To guide the StyleGAN flow generator to pay more attention to local garment deformation, a flow refinement module is introduced to add local context. Experiment results on a popular virtual try-on benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. It is particularly effective in a 'in-the-wild' application scenario where the reference image is full-body resulting in a large mis-alignment with the garment image.}}

The LfOSA framework introduces an auxiliary network to model the per-example max activation value (MAV) distribution with a Gaussian Mixture Model, which can dynamically select the examples with highest probability from known classes in the unlabeled set. Moreover, by reducing the temperature T of the loss function, the detection model will be further optimized by exploiting both known and unknown supervision. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the selection quality of known classes, and achieve higher classification accuracy with lower annotation cost than state-of-the-art active learning methods.

To better explore semi-supervised segmentation problem with video data, we formulate a semi-supervised video semantic segmentation task in this paper. For this task, we observe that the overfitting is surprisingly severe between labeled and unlabeled frames within a training video although they are very similar in style and contents. This is called inner-video overfitting, and it would actually lead to inferior performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel inter-frame feature reconstruction (IFR) technique to leverage the ground-truth labels to supervise the model training on unlabeled frames. IFR is essentially to utilize the internal relevance of different frames within a video. During training, IFR would enforce the feature distributions between labeled and unlabeled frames to be narrowed. Consequently, the inner-video overfitting issue can be effectively alleviated.

Specifically, we replace the fully connected classifier in neural networks with a Bayesian generative model of the neural network features. The model is trained from non-occluded images using bounding box annotations and class labels only, but is applied to generalize out-of-task to object segmentation and to generalize out-of-distribution to segment occluded objects. We demonstrate how such Bayesian models can naturally generalize beyond the training task labels when they learn a prior that models the object's background context and shape. Moreover, by leveraging an outlier process, Bayesian models can further generalize out-of-distribution to segment partially occluded objects and to predict their amodal object boundaries. Our algorithm outperforms alternative methods that use the same supervision by a large margin, and even outperforms methods where annotated amodal segmentations are used during training, when the amount of occlusion is large.

Specifically, the classic coherent point drift is revisited and generalizations have been proposed. First, by observing that the deformation model is essentially defined with respect to Euclidean space, we generalize the kernel method to non-Euclidean domains. This generally leads to better results for processing shapes, which are known as two-dimensional manifolds. Second, a generalized probabilistic model is proposed to address the sensibility of coherent point drift method to local optima. Instead of directly optimizing over the objective of coherent point drift, the new model allows to focus on a group of most confident ones, thus improves the robustness of the registration system. Experiments are conducted on multiple public datasets with comparison to state-of-the-art competitors, demonstrating the superiority of our method which is both flexible and efficient to improve the matching accuracy due to our extrinsic alignment objective in ambient space.}}

Most previous methods capture cross-modal interactions with a transformer-based multimodal encoder, not fully addressing the misalignment between unimodal video and text features. Besides, learning fine-grained visual-language alignment usually requires off-the-shelf object detectors to provide object information, which is bottlenecked by the detector's limited vocabulary and expensive computation cost. We propose Align and Prompt: an efficient and effective video-and-language pre-training framework with better cross-modal alignment. First, we introduce a video-text contrastive (VTC) loss to align unimodal video-text features at the instance level, which eases the modeling of cross-modal interactions. Then, we propose a new visually-grounded pre-training task, prompting entity modeling (PEM), which aims to learn fine-grained region-entity alignment. To achieve this, we first introduce an entity prompter module, which is trained with VTC to produce the similarity between a video crop and text prompts instantiated with entity names. The PEM task then asks the model to predict the entity pseudo-labels (i.e normalized similarity scores) for randomly-selected video crops. The resulting pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both text-video retrieval and videoQA, outperforming prior work by a substantial margin.

Unfortunately, the single-human assumption does not hold in images with multi-human occlusion and crowding. Consequently, top-down methods have difficulties in recovering accurate 3D human meshes under severe person-person occlusion. To address this, we present Occluded Human Mesh Recovery (OCHMR) - a novel top-down mesh recovery approach that incorporates image spatial context to overcome the limitations of the single-human assumption. The approach is conceptually simple and can be applied to any existing top-down architecture. Along with the input image, we condition the top-down model on spatial context from the image in the form of body-center heatmaps. To reason from the predicted body centermaps, we introduce Contextual Normalization (CoNorm) blocks to adaptively modulate intermediate features of the top-down model. The contextual conditioning helps our model disambiguate between two severely overlapping human bounding-boxes, making it robust to multi-person occlusion. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, OCHMR achieves superior performance on challenging multi-person benchmarks like 3DPW, CrowdPose, and OCHuman. Specifically, our proposed contextual reasoning architecture applied to the SPIN model with ResNet-50 backbone results in 75.2 PMPJPE on 3DPW-PC, 23.6 AP on CrowdPose, and 37.7 AP on OCHuman datasets, a significant improvement of 6.9 mm, 6.4 AP, and 20.8 AP respectively over the baseline.

These models can disentangle the 3D scene from the camera viewpoint in any generated image. However, most models do not disentangle other factors of image formation, such as geometry and appearance. In this paper, we design a 3D GAN which can learn a disentangled model of objects, just from monocular observations. Our model can disentangle the geometry and appearance variations in the scene, i.e., we can independently sample from the geometry and appearance spaces of the generative model. This is achieved using a novel non-rigid deformable scene formulation. A 3D volume which represents an object instance is computed as a non-rigidly deformed canonical 3D volume. Our method learns the canonical volume, as well as its deformations, jointly during training. This formulation also helps us improve the disentanglement between the 3D scene and the camera viewpoints using a novel pose regularization loss defined on the 3D deformation field. In addition, we further model the inverse deformations, enabling the computation of dense correspondences between images generated by our model. Finally, we design an approach to embed real images onto the latent space of our disentangled generative model, enabling editing of real images.}}

A fair benchmark is important for the further development of channel pruning. Meanwhile, recent investigations reveal that the channel configurations discovered by pruning algorithms are at least as important as the pre-trained weights. This gives channel pruning a new role, namely searching the optimal channel configuration. In this paper, we try to determine the channel configuration of the pruned models by random search. The proposed approach provides a new way to compare different methods, namely how well they behave compared with random pruning. We show that this simple strategy works quite well compared with other channel pruning methods.

Hence, prior methods are either restricted only to categories with no topological variation for estimating shape and correspondence or focus only on learning shape independently for each instance without any correspondence. To address this issue, we propose a topologically-aware deformation field that maps 3D points in object space to a higher-dimensional canonical space. Given a single image, we first implicitly deform a 3D point in the object space to a learned category-specific canonical space using the topologically-aware field and then learn the 3D shape in the canonical space. Both the canonical shape and deformation field are trained end-to-end using differentiable rendering via learned recurrent ray marcher.

There are two common CRF types: sparse and dense. Sparse CRF connects only the nearby pixels, while dense CRF has global connectivity. Therefore dense CRF is a more general model, but it is much harder to optimize compared to sparse CRF. In fact, only a certain form of dense CRF is optimized in practice, and even then approximately. We propose a new sparse non-local CRF: it has a sparse number of connections, but it has both local and non-local ones. Like sparse CRF, the total number of connections is small, and our model is easy to optimize exactly. Like dense CRF, our model is more general than sparse CRF due to non-local connections. We show that our sparse non-local CRF can model properties similar to that of the popular Gaussian edge dense CRF. Besides efficiency, another advantage is that our edge weights are less restricted compared to Gaussian edge dense CRF. We design models that take advantage of this flexibility. We also discuss connection of our model to other CRF models.

Yet, learning the entire set of unrestricted 2D-3D points from scratch fails to converge with existing approaches, since the deterministic pose is inherently non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose the EPro-PnP, a probabilistic PnP layer for general end-to-end pose estimation, which outputs a distribution of pose on the SE(3) manifold, essentially bringing categorical Softmax to the continuous domain. The 2D-3D coordinates and corresponding weights are treated as intermediate variables learned by minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and target pose distribution. The underlying principle unifies the existing approaches and resembles the attention mechanism.

To address this issue, we propose a Self-supervised Image-specific Prototype Exploration (SIPE) that consists of an Image-specific Prototype Exploration (IPE) and a General-Specific Consistency (GSC) loss. Specifically, IPE tailors prototypes for every image to capture complete regions, formed our Image-Specific CAM (IS-CAM).

While single image depth estimation is spared from these challenges and can achieve satisfactory results with the extracted monocular cues, the lack of stereoscopic relationship renders the monocular prediction less reliable on its own, especially in highly dynamic or cluttered environments. To address these issues in both scenarios, we present an optic-chiasm-inspired self-supervised binocular depth estimation method, wherein a vision transformer (ViT) with gated positional cross-attention (GPCA) layers is designed to enable feature-sensitive pattern retrieval between views while retaining the extensive context information aggregated through self-attentions. Monocular cues from a single view are thereafter conditionally rectified by a blending layer with the retrieved pattern pairs. This crossover design is biologically analogous to the optic-chasma structure in the human visual system and hence the name, ChiTransformer. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements over state-of-the-art self-supervised stereo approaches by 11%, and can be used on both rectilinear and non-rectilinear (e.g., fisheye) images.}}

Due to inherent sensor characteristics, Radar performs well under extreme weather conditions (snow, rain, fog) that significantly degrade camera and Lidar. Recently, a few works have developed vehicle detection methods fusing Lidar and Radar signals, i.e., MVDNet. However, these models are typically developed under the assumption that the models always have access to two error-free sensor streams. If one of the sensors is unavailable or missing, the model may fail catastrophically. To mitigate this problem, we propose the Self-Training Multimodal Vehicle Detection Network (ST-MVDNet) which leverages a Teacher-Student mutual learning framework and a simulated sensor noise model used in strong data augmentation for Lidar and Radar. We show that by (1) enforcing output consistency between a Teacher network and a Student network and by (2) introducing missing modalities (strong augmentations) during training, our learned model breaks away from the error-free sensor assumption. This consistency enforcement enables the Student model to handle missing data properly and improve the Teacher model by updating it with the Student model's exponential moving average. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed learning framework for multi-modal detection is able to better handle missing sensor data during inference. Furthermore, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance (5% gain) on the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset under various evaluation settings.}}

Neural classification models usually perform poorly on minority classes when training on such imbalanced datasets. To improve the performance on minority classes, existing methods typically re-balance the data distribution at the class level, i.e., assigning higher weights to minority classes and lower weights to majority classes during the training process. However, we observe that even the majority classes contain difficult instances to learn. By reducing the weights of the majority classes, such instances would become more difficult to learn and hurt the overall performance consequently. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel instance-level re-balancing strategy, which dynamically adjusts the sampling probabilities of instances according to the instance difficulty. Here the instance difficulty is measured based on the learning speed of instance, which is inspired by the human-leaning process (i.e., easier instances will be learned faster). We theoretically prove the correctness and convergence of our re-sampling algorithm. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art re-balancing methods on the class-imbalanced datasets.}}

Specifically, we propose the Spatial and Temporal ICT, in which we define two new interpolation schemes, i.e., the spatial interpolation and the temporal interpolation. We then derive the spatial and temporal interpolation consistency constraints accordingly for enhancing generalization in the pixel-wise classification task and for encouraging temporal consistent predictions, respectively. In addition, we design a Scale-Aware Network for multi-scale shadow knowledge learning in images, and propose a scale-consistency constraint to minimize the discrepancy among the predictions at different scales.

Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for their ability to represent a wide range of shapes with few parameters. However, as the first and foremost step, recovering superquadrics accurately and robustly from 3D data still remains challenging. The existing methods are subject to local optima and sensitive to noise and outliers in real-world scenarios, resulting in frequent failure in capturing geometric shapes. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic method to recover superquadrics from point clouds. Our method builds a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the parametric surface of a superquadric, which explicitly models the generation of outliers and noise. The superquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem. We propose an algorithm, Expectation, Maximization, and Switching (EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers are predicted from the posterior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is optimized by the trust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) local optima are avoided by globally searching and switching among parameters encoding similar superquadrics. We show that our method can be extended to the multi-superquadrics recovery for complex objects.

However, it inevitably poses an entirely new safety and security issue, i.e., highly personal and sensitive content can potentially be extracting by powerful CoSOD methods. In this paper, we address this problem from the perspective of adversarial attacks and identify a novel task: adversarial co-saliency attack. Specially, given an image selected from a group of images containing some common and salient objects, we aim to generate an adversarial version that can mislead CoSOD methods to predict incorrect co-salient regions. Note that, compared with general white-box adversarial attacks for classification, this new task faces two additional challenges: (1) low success rate due to the diverse appearance of images in the group; (2) low transferability across CoSOD methods due to the considerable difference between CoSOD pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose the very first black-box joint adversarial exposure and noise attack (Jadena), where we jointly and locally tune the exposure and additive perturbations of the image according to a newly designed high-feature-level contrast-sensitive loss function. Our method, without any information on the state-of-the-art CoSOD methods, leads to significant performance degradation on various co-saliency detection datasets and makes the co-salient objects undetectable. This can have strong practical benefits in properly securing the large number of personal photos currently shared on the Internet.

In this paper, we propose a new model, termed meta convolutional neural network, to solve the single domain generalization problem in image recognition. The key idea is to decompose the convolutional features of images into meta features. Acting as "visual words", meta features are defined as universal and basic visual elements for image representations (like words for documents in language). Taking meta features as reference, we propose compositional operations to eliminate irrelevant features of local convolutional features by an addressing process and then to reformulate the convolutional feature maps as a composition of related meta features. In this way, images are universally coded without biased information from the unseen domain, which can be processed by following modules trained in the source domain. The compositional operations adopt a regression analysis technique to learn the meta features in an online batch learning manner. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the superiority of the proposed model in improving single domain generalization ability.}}

Consequently, we propose the Rotation-enhanced Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (RUDA) for gaze estimation. First, we rotate the original images with different angles for training. Then we conduct domain adaptation under the constraint of rotation consistency. The target domain images are assigned with sub-labels, derived from relative rotation angles rather than untouchable real labels. With such sub-labels, we propose a novel distribution loss that facilitates the domain adaptation. We evaluate the RUDA framework on four cross-domain gaze estimation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that it improves the performance over the baselines with gains ranging from 12.2% to 30.5%.

Specifically, DML-CSR designs a multi-task model which comprises face parsing, binary edge, and category edge detection. These tasks only share low-level encoder weights without high-level interactions between each other, enabling to decouple auxiliary modules from the whole network at the inference stage.

We propose AUV-Net which learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module, taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning.

Concretely, we apply discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the input images and introduce a fusion module to capture the salient region of adversary in the frequency domain. Compared with existing adversarial attacks (e.g. FGSM, PGD) in the spatial domain, our method is more imperceptible to human observers and does not degrade the visual quality of the original images. Moreover, inspired by the idea of meta-learning, we also propose a hybrid adversarial attack that performs attacks in both the spatial and frequency domains.

The wide applicability of this technique thus requires the pattern synthesis approaches to be scalable, diverse, and authentic. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based visual pattern synthesis framework that aims to model the inner statistics of visual patterns and generate new, versatile patterns that meet the aforementioned requirements. To this end, we propose an implicit network based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and periodic encoding, thus calling our network the Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN). The design of IPFN ensures scalability: the implicit formulation directly maps the input coordinates to features, which enables synthesis of arbitrary size and is computationally efficient for 3D shape synthesis. Learning with a periodic encoding scheme encourages diversity: the network is constrained to model the inner statistics of the exemplar based on spatial latent codes in a periodic field. Coupled with continuously designed GAN training procedures, IPFN is shown to synthesize tileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. Last but not least, thanks to both the adversarial training technique and the encoded Fourier features, IPFN learns high-frequency functions that produce authentic, high-quality results. To validate our approach, we present novel experimental results on various applications in 2D texture synthesis and 3D shape synthesis.}}

In dense regression tasks such as depth estimation, where structural details are required, using a vanilla CNN layer on the distorted 360 image results in undesired information loss. In this paper, we propose a 360 monocular depth estimation pipeline, OmniFusion, to tackle the spherical distortion issue. Our pipeline transforms a 360 image into less-distorted perspective patches (i.e. tangent images) to obtain patch-wise predictions via CNN, and then merge the patch-wise results for final output. To handle the discrepancy between patch-wise predictions which is a major issue affecting the merging quality, we propose a new framework with the following key components. First, we propose a geometry-aware feature fusion mechanism that combines 3D geometric features with 2D image features to compensate for the patch-wise discrepancy. Second, we employ the self-attention-based transformer architecture to conduct a global aggregation of patch-wise information, which further improves the consistency. Last, we introduce an iterative depth refinement mechanism, to further refine the estimated depth based on the more accurate geometric features. Experiments show that our method greatly mitigates the distortion issue, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on several 360 monocular depth estimation benchmark datasets.}}

Our key observation is that the distance between the transcript of an unlabeled video and those of the weakly-labeled videos from the same task is small yet often nonzero. Therefore, we develop a Soft Restricted Edit (SRE) loss to encourage small variations between the predicted transcripts of unlabeled videos and ground-truth transcripts of the weakly-labeled videos of the same task. To compute the SRE loss, we develop a flexible transcript prediction (FTP) method that uses the output of the action classifier to find both the length of the transcript and the sequence of actions occurring in an unlabeled video. We propose an efficient learning scheme in which we alternate between minimizing our proposed loss and generating pseudo-transcripts for unlabeled videos.

In this paper, we introduce a visual hallucination framework, called VALHALLA, which requires only source sentences at inference time and instead uses hallucinated visual representations for multimodal machine translation. In particular, given a source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to predict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined text and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target translation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the translation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy losses while being guided by an additional loss that encourages consistency between predictions using either ground-truth or hallucinated visual representations. Extensive experiments on three standard translation datasets with a diverse set of language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over both text-only baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we approach the classical problem of face identification from a novel data-driven point of view. We cast it as a sequence generation problem: starting from an arbitrary edge, we adopt a variant of the popular Transformer model to predict the edges associated with the same face in a natural order. This allows us to avoid searching the space of all possible edge loops with various hand-crafted rules and heuristics as most existing methods do, deal with challenging cases such as curved surfaces and nested edge loops, and leverage additional cues such as face types.

In this study, we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative calculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy preserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly quantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art nonuniform quantization methods by 0.5 1.7% on ImageNet, demonstrating the contribution of N2UQ design.

We overcome these limitations and propose a method that learns to predict 3D shape and layout for objects without any ground truth shape or layout information: instead we rely on multi-view images with 2D supervision which can more easily be collected at scale. Through extensive experiments on ShapeNet, Hypersim, and ScanNet we demonstrate that our approach scales to large datasets of realistic images, and compares favorably to methods relying on 3D ground truth.

CPR constructs point bags, selects semantic-correlated points, and produces semantic center points through multiple instance learning (MIL). In this way, CPR defines a weakly supervised evolution procedure, which ensures training high-performance object localizer under coarse point supervision.

We propose to conduct novel Bayesian non-parametric submodular video partition (BN-SVP) to significantly improve MIL model training that can offer a highly reliable solution for robust anomaly detection in practical settings that include outlier segments or multiple types of abnormal events. BN-SVP essentially performs dynamic non-parametric hierarchical clustering with an enhanced self-transition that groups segments in a video into temporally consistent and semantically coherent hidden states that can be naturally interpreted as scenes. Each segment is assumed to be generated through a non-parametric mixture process that allows variations of segments within the same scenes to accommodate the dynamic and noisy nature of many real-world surveillance videos. The scene and mixture component assignment of BN-SVP also induces a pairwise similarity among segments, resulting in non-parametric construction of a submodular set function. Integrating this function with an MIL loss effectively exposes the model to a diverse set of potentially positive instances to improve its training. A greedy algorithm is developed to optimize the submodular function and support efficient model training. Our theoretical analysis ensures a strong performance guarantee of the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated over multiple real-world anomaly video datasets with robust detection performance.}}

FocalClick solves both issues at once by predicting and updating the mask in localized areas. For higher efficiency, we decompose the slow prediction on the entire image into two fast inferences on small crops: a coarse segmentation on the Target Crop, and a local refinement on the Focus Crop. To make the model work with preexisting masks, we formulate a sub-task termed Interactive Mask Correction, and propose Progressive Merge as the solution. Progressive Merge exploits morphological information to decide where to preserve and where to update, enabling users to refine any preexisting mask effectively.

To bridge this disentangled latent representation to the CLIP embedding, we design two code mappers that take a CLIP embedding as input and update the latent codes to reflect the targeted editing. The mappers are trained with a CLIP-based matching loss to ensure the manipulation accuracy.

Moreover, since 2D detection is more reliable currently, we also investigate how to use the detected 2D boxes as guidance to globally constrain the optimization of the corresponding predicted 3D boxes. To this end, a differentiable loss function, termed as Homography Loss, is proposed to achieve the goal, which exploits both 2D and 3D information, aiming at balancing the positional relationships between different objects by global constraints, so as to obtain more accurately predicted 3D boxes. Thanks to the concise design, our loss function is universal and can be plugged into any mature monocular 3D detector, while significantly boosting the performance over their baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields the best performance (Nov. 2021) compared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large margin on KITTI 3D datasets.}}

In this work, we propose to improve Sparse R-CNN with two dynamic designs. First, Sparse R-CNN adopts a one-to-one label assignment scheme, where the Hungarian algorithm is applied to match only one positive sample for each ground truth. Such one-to-one assignment may not be optimal for the matching between the learned proposal boxes and ground truths. To address this problem, we propose dynamic label assignment (DLA) based on the optimal transport algorithm to assign increasing positive samples in the iterative training stages of Sparse R-CNN. We constrain the matching to be gradually looser in the sequential stages as the later stage produces the refined proposals with improved precision. Second, the learned proposal boxes and features remain fixed for different images in the inference process of Sparse R-CNN. Motivated by dynamic convolution, we propose dynamic proposal generation (DPG) to assemble multiple proposal experts dynamically for providing better initial proposal boxes and features for the consecutive training stages. DPG thereby can derive sample-dependent proposal boxes and features for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method, named Dynamic Sparse R-CNN, can boost the strong Sparse R-CNN baseline with different backbones for object detection. Particularly, Dynamic Sparse R-CNN reaches the state-of-the-art 47.2% AP on the COCO 2017 validation set, surpassing Sparse R-CNN by 2.2% AP with the same ResNet-50 backbone.}}

To the best of our knowledge, no study about VSR pointed out this instability problem, which can be critical for some real-world applications. Video surveillance is a typical example where such artifacts would occur, as both the camera and the scene stay static for a long time. In this work, we expose instabilities of existing recurrent VSR networks on long sequences with low motion. We demonstrate it on a new long sequence dataset Quasi-Static Video Set, that we have created. Finally, we introduce a new framework of recurrent VSR networks that is both stable and competitive, based on Lipschitz stability theory.

The DG network consists of two modules, the ID-preserving Shape Generator (IDSG) and the Reenacted Face Generator (RFG). The IDSG encodes the 3D landmarks of the reference face into a reference landmark code, and encodes the source face into a source face code. The reference landmark code and the source face code are concatenated and decoded to a set of target landmarks that exhibits the pose and expression of the reference face and preserves the identity of the source face.}}

Our core contribution is a novel robust fitting formulation that solves a sequence of integer programs and terminates with a global solution or an error bound. The combinatorial subproblems are amenable to a quantum annealer, which helps to tighten the bound efficiently. While our usage of quantum computing does not surmount the fundamental intractability of robust fitting, by providing error bounds our algorithm is a practical improvement over randomised heuristics.

First, we constrain the pair-wise distance on the embedding space to reflect the similarity of corresponding dimensions so that the model can take advantage of inter-object information to learn more discriminative embeddings for dimension estimation. Second, we propose to learn representative shape templates on the dimension-aware embedding space.

Firstly, they always assume image noise obeys an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian or Laplacian distribution, which largely underestimates the complexity of real noise. Secondly, previous commonly-used kernel priors (e.g., normalization, sparsity) are not effective enough to guarantee a rational kernel solution, and thus degenerates the performance of subsequent SISR task. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a model-based blind SISR method under the probabilistic framework, which elaborately models image degradation from the perspectives of noise and blur kernel. Specifically, instead of the traditional i.i.d. noise assumption, a patch-based non-i.i.d. noise model is proposed to tackle the complicated real noise, expecting to increase the degrees of freedom of the model for noise representation. As for the blur kernel, we novelly con- struct a concise yet effective kernel generator, and plug it into the proposed blind SISR method as an explicit kernel prior (EKP).

To reduce expert effort, we present AutoSWAP: a framework for automatically synthesizing data-efficient task-level LFs.

First, we develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure - connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k demonstrations for Pick&Place, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. Our virtual teleoperation data contains 29.3M actions, and is equivalent to 22.6k hours of real-world teleoperation time, and illustrates rich, diverse strategies for solving the tasks. Second, we use this data to answer the question - how does large-scale imitation learning (IL) (which has not been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On ObjectNav, we find that IL (with no bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k agent-gathered trajectories. This effectively establishes an 'exchange rate' - a single human demonstration appears to be worth 4 agent-gathered ones. More importantly, we find the IL-trained agent learns efficient object-search behavior from humans - it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view - none of these are exhibited as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via contemporary RL techniques would require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On Pick&Place, the comparison is starker - IL agents achieve 18% success on episodes with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning. Project page: https://ram81.github.io/projects/habitat-web.}}

To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training with minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method, which encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves the network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the operations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to enhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and redundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization technique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is more efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of constructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate our effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by 2.04% on ImageNet and reduces 22% runtime over the baseline.}}

Using these horizontal and vertical class distribution labels, the network is guided to exploit the intrinsic position distribution of each class. We combine two guided features to form a spatial guidance map, which is then superimposed onto the baseline network by multiplication and concatenation to distinguish the human parts precisely.

In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) for unsupervised face subpart-part discovery. When browsing large-scale face images without labels, the network first encodes the frequently observed patterns with a set of explainable subpart capsules. Then, the subpart capsules are assembled into part-level capsules through a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn the compositional relations between them. During training, as the face hierarchy is progressively built and refined, the part capsules adaptively encode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule extends the application of capsule networks from digits to human faces and takes a step forward to show how the neural networks understand homologous objects without human intervention. Besides, HP-Capsule gives unsupervised face segmentation results by the covered regions of part capsules, enabling qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

How to construct vision-relevant and explainable multimodal knowledge for the VQA scenario has been less studied. In this paper, we propose MuKEA to represent multimodal knowledge by an explicit triplet to correlate visual objects and fact answers with implicit relations. To bridge the heterogeneous gap, we propose three objective losses to learn the triplet representations from complementary views: embedding structure, topological relation and semantic space.

In this paper, we call for an alternative paradigm for the OK-VQA task, which transforms the image into plain text, so that we can enable knowledge passage retrieval, and generative question-answering in the natural language space. This paradigm takes advantage of the sheer volume of gigantic knowledge bases and the richness of pre-trained language models. A Transform-Retrieve-Generate framework (TRiG) framework is proposed, which can be plug-and-played with alternative image-to-text models and textual knowledge bases.

The challenge in developing these networks lies in the nonlinearity of the embedding space namely, the Hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space is a homogeneous Riemannian manifold of the Lorentz group which is a semi-Riemannian manifold, i.e. a manifold equipped with an indefinite metric. Most existing methods (with some exceptions) use local linearization to define a variety of operations paralleling those used in traditional deep neural networks in Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we present a novel fully hyperbolic neural network which uses the concept of projections (embeddings) followed by an intrinsic aggregation and a nonlinearity all within the hyperbolic space. The novelty here lies in the projection which is designed to project data on to a lower-dimensional embedded hyperbolic space and hence leads to a nested hyperbolic space representation independently useful for dimensionality reduction. The main theoretical contribution is that the proposed embedding is proved to be isometric and equivariant under the Lorentz transformations, which are the natural isometric transformations in hyperbolic spaces. This projection is computationally efficient since it can be expressed by simple linear operations, and, due to the aforementioned equivariance property, it allows for weight sharing. The nested hyperbolic space representation is the core component of our network and therefore, we first compare this representation - independent of the network - with other dimensionality reduction methods such as tangent PCA, principal geodesic analysis (PGA) and HoroPCA. Based on this equivariant embedding, we develop a novel fully hyperbolic graph convolutional neural network architecture to learn the parameters of the projection. Finally, we present experiments demonstrating comparative performance of our network on several publicly available data sets.}}

We introduce a deep neural network with two branches to reverse each type of degradation, which is more effective than performing both restorations in a single forward network. We also propose an affine transform connection to replace the skip connection used in most existing DNNs for restoring UDC images. Confining the solution space to the linear transform domain reduces the blurring caused by convolution; and any gross color shift in the training images is eliminated by inverse color filtering. Trained on three datasets of UDC images, our network outperformed existing methods in terms of measures of distortion and of perceived image quality.}}

Recently, in light of the excellent performances of self-attention mechanism in the language field, transformers tailored for visual data have drawn numerous attention and triumphed CNNs in various vision tasks. These vision transformers heavily rely on large-scale pre-training to achieve competitive accuracy, which not only hinders the freedom of architectural design in downstream tasks like object detection, but also causes learning bias and domain mismatch in the fine-tuning stages. To this end, we aim to get rid of the "pre-train & fine-tune" paradigm of vision transformer and train transformer based object detector from scratch. Some earlier work in the CNNs era have successfully trained CNNs based detectors without pre-training, unfortunately, their findings do not generalize well when the backbone is switched from CNNs to vision transformer. Instead of proposing a specific vision transformer based detector, in this work, our goal is to reveal the insights of training vision transformer based detectors from scratch. In particular, we expect those insights can help other researchers and practitioners, and inspire more interesting research in other fields, such as semantic segmentation, visual-linguistic pre-training, etc. One of the key findings is that both architectural changes and more epochs play critical roles in training vision transformer based detectors from scratch. Experiments on MS COCO datasets demonstrate that vision transformer based detectors trained from scratch can also achieve similar performances to their counterparts with ImageNet pre-training.}}

However, such CSLR backbones are hard to be trained sufficiently with a single connectionist temporal classification loss. In this work, we propose two auxiliary constraints to enhance the CSLR backbones from the perspective of consistency. The first constraint aims to enhance the visual module, which easily suffers from the insufficient training problem. Specifically, since sign languages convey information mainly with signers' faces and hands, we insert a keypoint-guided spatial attention module into the visual module to enforce it to focus on informative regions, i.e., spatial attention consistency. Nevertheless, only enhancing the visual module may not fully exploit the power of the backbone. Motivated by that both the output features of the visual and sequential modules represent the same sentence, we further impose a sentence embedding consistency constraint between them to enhance the representation power of both the features. Experimental results over three representative backbones validate the effectiveness of the two constraints. More remarkably, with a transformer-based backbone, our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on three benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014-T, and CSL.}}

However, the definition of what is fine-grained is subjective, and the image quality may affect the identification. Thus, samples could be observed at any level of the hierarchy, e.g., ["Albatross"] or ["Albatross", "Laysan Albatross"], and examples discerned at coarse categories are often neglected in the conventional setting of HMC. In this paper, we study the HMC problem in which objects are labeled at any level of the hierarchy. The essential designs of the proposed method are derived from two motivations: (1) learning with objects labeled at various levels should transfer hierarchical knowledge between levels; (2) lower-level classes should inherit attributes related to upper-level superclasses. The proposed combinatorial loss maximizes the marginal probability of the observed ground truth label by aggregating information from related labels defined in the tree hierarchy. If the observed label is at the leaf level, the combinatorial loss further imposes the multi-class cross-entropy loss to increase the weight of fine-grained classification loss. Considering the hierarchical feature interaction, we propose a hierarchical residual network (HRN), in which granularity-specific features from parent levels acting as residual connections are added to features of children levels. Experiments on three commonly used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art HMC approaches.

However, the FR problem is not perfectly solved in case of uncontrolled illumination and pose. In this paper, we propose to enhance face recognition with a bypass of self-supervised 3D reconstruction, which enforces the neural backbone to focus on the identity-related depth and albedo information while neglects the identity-irrelevant pose and illumination information. Specifically, inspired by the physical model of image formation, we improve the backbone FR network by introducing a 3D face reconstruction loss with two auxiliary networks. The first one estimates the pose and illumination from the input face image while the second one decodes the canonical depth and albedo from the intermediate feature of the FR backbone network. The whole network is trained in end-to-end manner with both classic face identification loss and the loss of 3D face reconstruction with the physical parameters. In this way, the self-supervised reconstruction acts as a regularization that enables the recognition network to understand faces in 3D view, and the learnt features are forced to encode more information of canonical facial depth and albedo, which is more intrinsic and beneficial to face recognition. Extensive experimental results on various face recognition benchmarks show that, without any cost of extra annotations and computations, our method outperforms state-of-the-art ones. Moreover, the learnt representations can also well generalize to other face-related downstream tasks such as the facial attribute recognition with limited labeled data.}}

Different from previous approaches that learn robust deep representations of scene text in a holistic manner, our method performs scene text detection based on a few representative features, which avoids the disturbance by background and reduces the computational cost. Specifically, we first select a few representative features at all scales that are highly relevant to foreground text. Then, we adopt a transformer for modeling the relationship of the sampled features, which effectively divides them into reasonable groups. As each feature group corresponds to a text instance, its bounding box can be easily obtained without any post-processing operation. Using the basic feature pyramid network for feature extraction, our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular datasets for scene text detection.}}

In this paper, we present a practical unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model, which is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and using the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in the next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high performance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances over existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised methods. In addition, we argue that existing denoising datasets are of low quality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image denoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw image dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes. The dataset can serve as a strong benchmark for better evaluating raw image denoising. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/zhangyi-3/IDR}}

Typically, the architectures of the backbone, feature pyramid layer, and detection head module within the face detector all assimilate the excellent experience from general object detectors. However, several effective methods, including label assignment and scale-level data augmentation strategy, fail to maintain consistent superiority when applying on the face detector directly. Concretely, the former strategy involves a vast body of hyper-parameters and the latter one suffers from the challenge of scale distribution bias between different detection tasks, which both limit their generalization abilities. Furthermore, in order to provide accurate face bounding boxes for facial down-stream tasks, the face detector imperatively requires the elimination of false alarms. As a result, practical solutions on label assignment, scale-level data augmentation, and reducing false alarms are necessary for advancing face detectors.

Inspired by language emergence literature, we propose multi-label iterated learning (MILe) to incorporate the inductive biases of multi-label learning from single labels using the framework of iterated learning. MILe is a simple yet effective procedure that builds a multi-label description of the image by propagating binary predictions through successive generations of teacher and student networks with a learning bottleneck. Experiments show that our approach exhibits systematic benefits on ImageNet accuracy as well as ReaL F1 score, which indicates that MILe deals better with label ambiguity than the standard training procedure, even when fine-tuning from self-supervised weights. We also show that MILe is effective reducing label noise, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world large-scale noisy data such as WebVision. Furthermore, MILe improves performance in class incremental settings such as IIRC and it is robust to distribution shifts.}}

This is partly because of highly optimized implementations such as XGBoost or LightGBM, which incorporate many clever modifications and heuristics. However, one gaping hole remains unexplored in GB: the construction of individual trees. To date, all successful GB versions use axis-aligned trees trained in a suboptimal way via greedy recursive partitioning. We address this gap by using a more powerful type of trees (having hyperplane splits) and an algorithm that can optimize, globally over all the tree parameters, the objective function that GB dictates. We show, in several benchmarks of image and other data types, that GB forests of these stronger, well-optimized trees consistently exceed the test accuracy of axis-aligned forests from XGBoost, LightGBM and other strong baselines. Further, this happens using many fewer trees and sometimes even fewer parameters overall.}}

The affinities are then supervised to estimate the trajectory and guide the flow of information between corresponding 3D objects.

The implicit assumption behind such successes is that the feature maps across consecutive frames can be nicely aggregated. Nevertheless, the assumption may not always hold especially for the regions with large deformation. In this paper, we present a new recipe of inter-frame attention block, namely Stand-alone Inter-Frame Attention (SIFA), that novelly delves into the deformation across frames to estimate local self-attention on each spatial location. Technically, SIFA remoulds the deformable design via re-scaling the offset predictions by the difference between two frames. Taking each spatial location in the current frame as the query, the locally deformable neighbors in the next frame are regarded as the keys/values. Then, SIFA measures the similarity between query and keys as stand-alone attention to weighted average the values for temporal aggregation. We further plug SIFA block into ConvNets and Vision Transformer, respectively, to devise SIFA-Net and SIFA-Transformer. Extensive experiments conducted on four video datasets demonstrate the superiority of SIFA-Net and SIFA-Transformer as stronger backbones. More remarkably, SIFA-Transformer achieves an accuracy of 83.1% on Kinetics-400 dataset. Source code is available at https://github.com/FuchenUSTC/SIFA.}}

However, most existing methods are designed in a black-box principle, lacking sufficient interpretability. Additionally, they ignore the different characteristics of each band of MS images and directly concatenate them with panchromatic (PAN) images, leading to severe copy artifacts. To address the above issues, we propose an interpretable deep neural network, namely Memory-augmented Deep Conditional Unfolding Network with two specified core designs. Firstly, considering the degradation process, it formulates the Pan-sharpening problem as the minimization of a variational model with denoising-based prior and non-local auto-regression prior which is capable of searching the similarities between long-range patches, benefiting the texture enhancement. A novel iteration algorithm with built-in CNNs is exploited for transparent model design. Secondly, to fully explore the potentials of different bands of MS images, the PAN image is combined with each band of MS images, selectively providing the high-frequency details and alleviating the copy artifacts. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods.}}

To setup the pre-training task, we apply a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos of an existing unlabeled Re-ID dataset "LUPerson" and build the Noisy Labeled variant called "LUPerson-NL". Since theses ID labels automatically derived from tracklets inevitably contain noises, we develop a large-scale Pre-training framework utilizing Noisy Labels (PNL), which consists of three learning modules: supervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and label-guided contrastive learning. In principle, joint learning of these three modules not only clusters similar examples to one prototype, but also rectifies noisy labels based on the prototype assignment. We demonstrate that learning directly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which utilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. This simple pre-training task provides a scalable way to learn SOTA Re-ID representations from scratch on "LUPerson-NL" without bells and whistles. For example, by applying on the same supervised Re-ID method MGN, our pre-trained model improves the mAP over the unsupervised pre-training counterpart by 5.7%, 2.2%, 2.3% on CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17 respectively. Under the small-scale or few-shot setting, the performance gain is even more significant, suggesting a better transferability of the learned representation.

Target Pedestrians (TP) are often disturbed by Non-Pedestrian Occlusions (NPO) and Non-Target Pedestrians (NTP). Previous methods mainly focus on increasing the model's robustness against NPO while ignoring feature contamination from NTP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Erasing and Diffusion Network (FED) to simultaneously handle challenges from NPO and NTP. Specifically, aided by the NPO augmentation strategy that simulates NPO on holistic pedestrian images and generates precise occlusion masks, NPO features are explicitly eliminated by our proposed Occlusion Erasing Module (OEM). Subsequently, we diffuse the pedestrian representations with other memorized features to synthesize the NTP characteristics in the feature space through the novel Feature Diffusion Module (FDM). With the guidance of the occlusion scores from OEM, the feature diffusion process is conducted on visible body parts, thereby improving the quality of the synthesized NTP characteristics. We can greatly improve the model's perception ability towards TP and alleviate the influence of NPO and NTP by jointly optimizing OEM and FDM. Furthermore, the proposed FDM works as an auxiliary module for training and will not be engaged in the inference phase, thus with high flexibility. Experiments on occluded and holistic person ReID benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FED over state-of-the-art methods.}}

As a compromise, semantic segmentation has long been modeled as per-point prediction on dense regular grids. In this work, we present a novel and efficient modeling that starts from interpreting the image as a tessellation of learnable regions, each of which has flexible geometrics and carries homogeneous semantics. To model region-wise context, we exploit Transformer to encode regions in a sequence-to-sequence manner by applying multi-layer self-attention on the region embeddings, which serve as proxies of specific regions. Semantic segmentation is now carried out as per-region prediction on top of the encoded region embeddings using a single linear classifier, where a decoder is no longer needed. The proposed RegProxy model discards the common Cartesian feature layout and operates purely at region level. Hence, it exhibits the most competitive performance-efficiency trade-off compared with the conventional dense prediction methods. For example, on ADE20K, the small-sized RegProxy-S/16 outperforms the best CNN model using 25% parameters and 4% computation, while the largest RegProxy-L/16 achieves 52.9mIoU which outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.1% with fewer resources.

While degradation-specific image restoration techniques have been extensively studied, such algorithms are domain sensitive and fail in real scenarios where multiple degradations exist simultaneously. This makes a case for blind image restoration and reconstruction algorithms as practically relevant. However, the absence of a dataset diverse enough to encapsulate all variations hinders development for such an algorithm. In this paper, we utilize a synthetic degradation model that recursively applies sets of random degradations to generate naturalistic degradation images of varying complexity, which are used as input. Furthermore, as the degradation intensity can vary across an image, the spatially invariant convolutional filter cannot be applied for all degradations. Hence to enable spatial variance during image restoration and reconstruction, we design a transformer-based architecture to benefit from the long-range dependencies. In addition, to reduce the computational cost of transformers, we propose a multi-branch structure coupled with modifications such as a complimentary feature selection mechanism and the replacement of a feed-forward network with lightweight multiscale convolutions. Finally, to improve restoration and reconstruction, we integrate an auxiliary decoder branch to predict the degradation mask to ensure the underlying network can localize the degradation information. From empirical analysis on 10 datasets covering rain drop removal, deraining, dehazing, image enhancement, and deblurring, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach while obtaining SoTA performance.}}

This is due in part to object instances being annotated with ground-truth in the form of polygonal boundaries or segmentation masks, yet being evaluated in a convenient manner using only segmentation masks. Our method, named BoundaryFormer, is a Transformer based architecture that directly predicts polygons yet uses instance mask segmentations as the ground-truth supervision for computing the loss. We achieve this by developing an end-to-end differentiable model that solely relies on supervision within the mask space through differentiable rasterization. BoundaryFormer matches or surpasses the Mask R-CNN method in terms of instance segmentation quality on both COCO and Cityscapes while exhibiting significantly better transferability across datasets.}}

Recent works have demonstrated that the accuracy of an SVDE method hugely depends on the diversity and volume of the training data. However, RGB-D datasets obtained via depth capturing or 3D reconstruction are typically small, synthetic datasets are not photorealistic enough, and all these datasets lack diversity. The large-scale and diverse data can be sourced from stereo images or stereo videos from the web. Typically being uncalibrated, stereo data provides disparities up to unknown shift (geometrically incomplete data), so stereo-trained SVDE methods cannot recover 3D geometry. It was recently shown that the distorted point clouds obtained with a stereo-trained SVDE method can be corrected with additional point cloud modules (PCM) separately trained on the geometrically complete data. On the contrary, we propose GP2, General-Purpose and Geometry-Preserving training scheme, and show that conventional SVDE models can learn correct shifts themselves without any post-processing, benefiting from using stereo data even in the geometry-preserving setting. Through experiments on different dataset mixtures, we prove that GP2-trained models outperform methods relying on PCM in both accuracy and speed, and report the state-of-the-art results in the general-purpose geometry-preserving SVDE. Moreover, we show that SVDE models can learn to predict geometrically correct depth even when geometrically complete data comprises the minor part of the training set.}}

LD-ConGR is distinguished from existing gesture datasets by its long-distance gesture collection, fine-grained annotations, and high video quality. Specifically, 1) the farthest gesture provided by the LD-ConGR is captured 4m away from the camera while existing gesture datasets collect gestures within 1m from the camera; 2) besides the gesture category, the temporal segmentation of gestures and hand location are also annotated in LD-ConGR; 3) videos are captured at high resolution (1280x720 for color streams and 640x576 for depth streams) and high frame rate (30 fps). On top of the LD-ConGR, a series of experimental and studies are conducted, and the proposed gesture region estimation and key frame sampling strategies are demonstrated to be effective in dealing with long-distance gesture recognition and the uncertainty of gesture duration.

In this paper, a new end-to-end unsupervised motion transfer framework is proposed to overcome such issue. Firstly, we propose thin-plate spline motion estimation to produce a more flexible optical flow, which warps the feature maps of the source image to the feature domain of the driving image. Secondly, in order to restore the missing regions more realistically, we leverage multi-resolution occlusion masks to achieve more effective feature fusion.

Adversarial Training (AT) is a technique that approximately solves a robust optimization problem to minimize the worst-case loss and is widely regarded as the most effective defense against such attacks. Due to the high computation time for generating strong adversarial examples in the AT process, single-step approaches have been proposed to reduce training time. However, these methods suffer from catastrophic overfitting where adversarial accuracy drops during training, and although improvements have been proposed, they increase training time and robustness is far from that of multi-step AT. We develop a theoretical framework for adversarial training with FW optimization (FW-AT) that reveals a geometric connection between the loss landscape and the distortion of l-inf FW attacks (the attack's l-2 norm). Specifically, we analytically show that high distortion of FW attacks is equivalent to small gradient variation along the attack path. It is then experimentally demonstrated on various deep neural network architectures that l-inf attacks against robust models achieve near maximal l-2 distortion, while standard networks have lower distortion. Furthermore, it is experimentally shown that catastrophic overfitting is strongly correlated with low distortion of FW attacks. This mathematical transparency differentiates FW from the more popular Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) optimization. To demonstrate the utility of our theoretical framework we develop FW-AT-Adapt, a novel adversarial training algorithm which uses a simple distortion measure to adapt the number of attack steps during training to increase efficiency without compromising robustness. FW-AT-Adapt provides training time on par with single-step fast AT methods and improves closing the gap between fast AT methods and multi-step PGD-AT with minimal loss in adversarial accuracy in white-box and black-box settings.}}

Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching (ViM), which combines the class-agnostic score from feature space and the In-Distribution (ID) class-dependent logits. Specifically, an additional logit representing the virtual OOD class is generated from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and then matched with the original logits by a constant scaling.

Moreover, we introduce a novel Multi-scale Actor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) between two interactive paths of Dual-AI. Via self-supervised actor consistency in both frame and video levels, MAC-Loss can effectively distinguish individual actor representations to reduce action confusion among different actors. Consequently, our Dual-AI can boost group activity recognition by fusing such discriminative features of different actors. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely used benchmarks, including Volleyball, Collective Activity, and NBA datasets. The proposed Dual-AI achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets.

In this work, we study the learning dynamics of deep segmentation networks trained on inaccurately-annotated data. We discover a phenomenon that has been previously reported in the context of classification: the networks tend to first fit the clean pixel-level labels during an "early-learning" phase, before eventually memorizing the false annotations. However, in contrast to classification, memorization in segmentation does not arise simultaneously for all semantic categories. Inspired by these findings, we propose a new method for segmentation from noisy annotations with two key elements. First, we detect the beginning of the memorization phase separately for each category during training. This allows us to adaptively correct the noisy annotations in order to exploit early learning. Second, we incorporate a regularization term that enforces consistency across scales to boost robustness against annotation noise. Our method outperforms standard approaches on a medical-imaging segmentation task where noises are synthesized to mimic human annotation errors. It also provides robustness to realistic noisy annotations present in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012.

Our method first employs deep learning-based edge detection to extract various types of large-scale edges. Then, the extracted edges are sampled to construct multiple groups of triangles to represent geometric structures. Meanwhile, a GEometric Structure preserving (GES) energy term is introduced to make these triangles undergo similarity transformation. Further, an optimized GES energy term is presented to reasonably determine the weights of the sampling points on the geometric structure, and the term is added into the Global Similarity Prior (GSP) stitching model called GES-GSP to achieve a smooth transition between local alignment and geometric structure preservation. The effectiveness of GES-GSP is validated through comprehensive experiments on a stitching dataset.

Our insight is to decouple the audio-visual driving sources through prior-based pre-processing designs. Detailedly, we disassemble the driving image into three complementary parts including: 1) a cropped mouth that facilitates lip-sync; 2) a masked head that implicitly learns pose; and 3) the upper face which works corporately and complementarily with a time-shifted mouth to contribute the expression.

Recently, causality has become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest. To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data. Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant transformations.}}

A key challenge of learning the dynamics of the appearance lies in the requirement of a prohibitively large amount of observations. In this paper, we present a compact motion representation by enforcing equivariance---a representation is expected to be transformed in the way that the pose is transformed. We model an equivariant encoder that can generate the generalizable representation from the spatial and temporal derivatives of the 3D body surface. This learned representation is decoded by a compositional multi-task decoder that renders high fidelity time-varying appearance.

In this paper, we address the prediction accuracy problem of consistency learning methods with novel extensions of the mean-teacher (MT) model, which include a new auxiliary teacher, and the replacement of MT's mean square error (MSE) by a stricter confidence-weighted cross-entropy (Conf-CE) loss. The accurate prediction by this model allows us to use a challenging combination of network, input data and feature perturbations to improve the consistency learning generalisation, where the feature perturbations consist of a new adversarial perturbation.

However, when the image resolution reaches gigapixel-level, they will suffer from a huge time cost for detecting numerous patches. Different from them, we devise a novel patch arrangement framework for fast object detection on gigapixel-level images. Under this framework, a Patch Arrangement Network (PAN) is proposed to accelerate the detection by determining which patches could be packed together into a compact canvas. Specifically, PAN consists of (1) a Patch Filter Module (PFM) (2) a Patch Packing Module (PPM). PFM filters patch candidates by learning to select patches between two granularities. Subsequently, from the remaining patches, PPM determines how to pack these patches together into a smaller number of canvases. Meanwhile, it generates an ideal layout of patches on canvas. These canvases are fed to the detector to get final results. Experiments show that our method could improve the inference speed on gigapixel-level images by 5 times while maintaining great performance.}}

Then, we propose MLSLT, the first MSLT model, which contains two novel dynamic routing mechanisms for controlling the degree of parameter sharing between different languages. Intra-layer language-specific routing controls the proportion of data flowing through shared parameters and language-specific parameters from the token level through a soft gate within the layer, and inter-layer language-specific routing controls and learns the data flow path of different languages at the language level through a soft gate between layers.

Experimental results show that the average performance of MLSLT outperforms the baseline MSLT model and the combination of multiple BSLT models in many cases.

Specifically, we transfer hand mesh information to the object branch and vice versa for the hand branch. The resulting optimisation (training) problem can be unstable, and we address this via two strategies: (i) attention-guided graph convolution which helps identify and focus on mutual occlusion and (ii) unsupervised associative loss which facilitates the transfer of information between the branches.

Our work alleviates this from a novel perspective, by exploring rich semantic contexts synergistically among abundant weakly-labeled training data for network learning and inference. In particular, we propose regional semantic contrast and aggregation (RCA). RCA is equipped with a regional memory bank to store massive, diverse object patterns appearing in training data, which acts as strong support for exploration of dataset-level semantic structure. Particularly, we propose i) semantic contrast to drive network learning by contrasting massive categorical object regions, leading to a more holistic object pattern understanding, and ii) semantic aggregation to gather diverse relational contexts in the memory to enrich semantic representations. In this manner, RCA earns a strong capability of fine-grained semantic understanding, and eventually establishes new state-of-the-art results on two popular benchmarks, i.e., PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014.}}

Yet, we find that the crux of the unsatisfactory pseudo masks is the binary cross-entropy loss (BCE) widely used in CAM. Specifically, due to the sum-over-class pooling nature of BCE, each pixel in CAM may be responsive to multiple classes co-occurring in the same receptive field. As a result, given a class, its hot CAM pixels may wrongly invade the area belonging to other classes, or the non-hot ones may be actually a part of the class. To this end, we introduce an embarrassingly simple yet surprisingly effective method: Reactivating the converged CAM with BCE by using softmax cross-entropy loss (SCE), dubbed ReCAM. Given an image, we use CAM to extract the feature pixels of every single class, and use them with the class label to learn another fully-connected layer (after the backbone) with SCE. Once converged, we extract ReCAM in the same way as in CAM. Thanks to the contrastive nature of SCE, the pixel response is disentangled into different classes and hence less mask ambiguity is expected. The evaluation on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO shows that ReCAM can not only generates high-quality masks, but also supports plug-and-play in any CAM variant with little overhead.}}

We focus on the supervised setup, in which ground-truth depth is available only at training time. Based on knowledge about the high regularity of real 3D scenes, we propose a method that learns to selectively leverage information from coplanar pixels to improve the predicted depth. In particular, we introduce a piecewise planarity prior which states that for each pixel, there is a seed pixel which shares the same planar 3D surface with the former. Motivated by this prior, we design a network with two heads. The first head outputs pixel-level plane coefficients, while the second one outputs a dense offset vector field that identifies the positions of seed pixels. The plane coefficients of seed pixels are then used to predict depth at each position. The resulting prediction is adaptively fused with the initial prediction from the first head via a learned confidence to account for potential deviations from precise local planarity. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end thanks to the differentiability of the proposed modules and it learns to predict regular depth maps, with sharp edges at occlusion boundaries.

More recently, convolution-free networks, based on multi-head self-attention (MSA) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), become more and more popular. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when utilizing these newly-minted networks for video recognition due to the large variations and complexities in video data. In this paper, we present MLP-3D networks, a novel MLP-like 3D architecture for video recognition. Specifically, the architecture consists of MLP-3D blocks, where each block contains one MLP applied across tokens (i.e., token-mixing MLP) and one MLP applied independently to each token (i.e., channel MLP). By deriving the novel grouped time mixing (GTM) operations, we equip the basic token-mixing MLP with the ability of temporal modeling. GTM divides the input tokens into several temporal groups and linearly maps the tokens in each group with the shared projection matrix. Furthermore, we devise several variants of GTM with different grouping strategies, and compose each variant in different blocks of MLP-3D network by greedy architecture search. Without the dependence on convolutions or attention mechanisms, our MLP-3D networks achieves 68.5%/81.4% top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets, respectively. Despite with fewer computations, the results are comparable to state-of-the-art widely-used 3D CNNs and video transformers.}}

Our key insight is to merge three schools of thought: (1) classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend skinning, (2) canonical embeddings that establish correspondences between pixels and a canonical 3D model, and (3) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to gradient-based optimization. We introduce neural blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with cycle consistency.

Concretely, we introduce a small set of object queries conditioned on the language as the input to the Transformer. In this manner, all the queries are obligated to find the referred objects only. They are eventually transformed into dynamic kernels which capture the crucial object-level information, and play the role of convolution filters to generate the segmentation masks from feature maps. The object tracking is achieved naturally by linking the corresponding queries across frames. This mechanism greatly simplifies the pipeline and the endto-end framework is significantly different from the previous methods. Extensive experiments on Ref-Youtube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences show the effectiveness of ReferFormer.

While high dimensional hyperbolic embeddings lead to better representations, most hyperbolic models utilize low-dimensional embeddings, due to non-trivial optimization and visualization of high-dimensional hyperbolic data. We propose CO-SNE, which extends the Euclidean space visualization tool, t-SNE, to hyperbolic space. Like t-SNE, it converts distances between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of high-dimensional data X and low-dimensional embedding Y. However, unlike Euclidean space, hyperbolic space is inhomogeneous: A volume could contain a lot more points at a location far from the origin. CO-SNE thus uses hyperbolic normal distributions for X and hyperbolic Cauchy instead of t-SNE's Student's t-distribution for Y , and it additionally seeks to preserve X's individual distances to the Origin in Y. We apply CO-SNE to naturally hyperbolic data and supervisedly learned hyperbolic features. Our results demonstrate that CO-SNE deflates high-dimensional hyperbolic data into a low-dimensional space without losing their hyperbolic characteristics, significantly outperforming popular visualization tools such as PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and HoroPCA which is also designed for hyperbolic data}}

Specifically, inspired by the known deformable part model (DPM), our DAM introduces two types of anchors or keypoints: i) a number of motion anchors that capture both appearance and motion information from the source image and driving video; ii) a latent root anchor, which is linked to the motion anchors to facilitate better learning of the representations of the object structure information. Moreover, DAM can be further extended to a hierarchical version through the introduction of additional latent anchors to model more complicated structures. By regularizing motion anchors with latent anchor(s), DAM enforces the correspondences between them to ensure the structural information is well captured and preserved. Moreover, DAM can be learned effectively in an unsupervised manner. We validate our proposed DAM for motion transfer on different benchmark datasets.

Existing WSSS methods commonly argue that the sparse coverage of CAM incurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and empirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a global thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can be mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the foreground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the background activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation manipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label conditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level activation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discriminative parts, promote the less discriminative parts, and deactivate the background regions. Label conditioning imposes that the output label of pseudo-masks should be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation assigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analysis and evaluations, we demonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving the robustness against the choice of the global threshold.

PubTables-1M contains nearly one million tables from scientific articles, supports multiple input modalities, and contains detailed header and location information for table structures, making it useful for a wide variety of modeling approaches. It also addresses a significant source of ground truth inconsistency observed in prior datasets called oversegmentation, using a novel canonicalization procedure. We demonstrate that these improvements lead to a significant increase in training performance and a more reliable estimate of model performance at evaluation for table structure recognition.

Up to now, the study of continual learning in computer vision is mainly restricted to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, recently there is a tendency that the newly emerging vision transformers (ViTs) are gradually dominating the field of computer vision, which leaves CNN-based continual learning lagging behind as they can suffer from severe performance degradation if straightforwardly applied to ViTs. In this paper, we study ViT-backed continual learning to strive for higher performance riding on recent advances of ViTs. Inspired by mask-based continual learning methods in CNNs, where a mask is learned per task to adapt the pre-trained ViT to the new task, we propose MEta-ATtention (MEAT), i.e., attention to self-attention, to adapt a pre-trained ViT to new tasks without sacrificing performance on already learned tasks. Unlike prior mask-based methods like Piggyback, where all parameters are associated with corresponding masks, MEAT leverages the characteristics of ViTs and only masks a portion of its parameters. It renders MEAT more efficient and effective with less overhead and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEAT exhibits significant superiority to its state-of-the-art CNN counterparts, with 4.0 6.0% absolute boosts in accuracy.

In this work, we propose a principled framework, Recurrent Tri-Level Transform (RT-VTON), that performs full-range virtual try-on on both standard and non-standard clothes. We have two key insights towards the framework design: 1) Semantics transfer requires a gradual feature transform on three different levels of clothing representations, namely clothes code, pose code and parsing code. 2) Geometry transfer requires a regularized image deformation between rigidity and flexibility. Firstly, we predict the semantics of the "after-try-on" person by recurrently refining the tri-level feature codes using local gated attention and non-local correspondence learning. Next, we design a semi-rigid deformation to align the clothing image and the predicted semantics, which preserves local warping similarity. Finally, a canonical try-on synthesizer fuses all the processed information to generate the clothed person image. Extensive experiments on conventional benchmarks along with user studies demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, RT-VTON shows compelling results on a wide range of non-standard clothes.}}

Similarly to distillation approaches, our single network is trained to maximise the probability of samples from pre-trained probabilistic models, in this work we use a fixed ensemble of networks. Once trained, our compact representation can be used to efficiently draw spatially correlated samples from the approximated output distribution. Importantly, this approach captures the uncertainty and structured correlations in the predictions explicitly in a formal distribution, rather than implicitly through sampling alone. This allows direct introspection of the model, enabling visualisation of the learned structure.

However, previous data-end defenses show low generalization against diverse noises and weak transferability across multiple models. Motivated by the fact that robust recognition depends on both local and global features, we propose a defensive patch generation framework to address these problems by helping models better exploit these features. For the generalization against diverse noises, we inject class-specific identifiable patterns into a confined local patch prior, so that defensive patches could preserve more recognizable features towards specific classes, leading models for better recognition under noises. For the transferability across multiple models, we guide the defensive patches to capture more global feature correlations within a class, so that they could activate model-shared global perceptions and transfer better among models. Our defensive patches show great potentials to improve model robustness in practice by simply sticking them around target objects. Extensive experiments show that we outperform others by large margins (improve 20+% accuracy for both adversarial and corruption robustness on average in the digital and physical world).}}

In order to accurately localize the active object, any method must reason using information encoded by each image pixel, such as whether it belongs to the hand, the object, or the background. To leverage each pixel as evidence to determine the bounding box of the active object, we propose a pixel-wise voting function. Our pixel-wise voting function takes an initial bounding box as input and produces an improved bounding box of the active object as output. The voting function is designed so that each pixel inside of the input bounding box votes for an improved bounding box, and the box with the majority vote is selected as the output. We call the collection of bounding boxes generated inside of the voting function, the Relational Box Field, as it characterizes a field of bounding boxes defined in relationship to the current bounding box. While our voting function is able to improve the bounding box of the active object, one round of voting is typically not enough to accurately localize the active object. Therefore, we repeatedly apply the voting function to sequentially improve the location of the bounding box. However, since it is known that repeatedly applying a one-step predictor (i.e., auto-regressive processing with our voting function) can cause a data distribution shift, we mitigate this issue using reinforcement learning (RL). We adopt standard RL to learn the voting function parameters and show that it provides a meaningful improvement over a standard supervised learning approach. We perform experiments on two large-scale datasets: 100DOH and MECCANO, improving AP50 performance by 8% and 30%, respectively, over the state of the art.

Recent advances can achieve impressive results with the help of GAN prior. They either design complicated modules to modify the fixed GAN prior or adopt complex training strategies to finetune the generator. In this work, we propose a generative and controllable face SR framework, called GCFSR, which can reconstruct images with faithful identity information without any additional priors. Generally, GCFSR has an encoder-generator architecture. Two modules called style modulation and feature modulation are designed for the multi-factor SR task. The style modulation aims to generate realistic face details and the feature modulation dynamically fuses the multi-level encoded features and the generated ones conditioned on the upscaling factor. The simple and elegant architecture can be trained from scratch in an end-to-end manner. For small upscaling factors (\leq8), GCFSR can produce surprisingly good results with only adversarial loss. After adding L1 and perceptual losses, GCFSR can outperform state-of-the-art methods for large upscaling factors (16, 32, 64). During the test phase, we can modulate the generative strength via feature modulation by changing the conditional upscaling factor continuously to achieve various generative effects.

The number of particles imaged in a 1 Megapixel image is typically in the order of 1e3-1e4, resulting in a large number of consistent but incorrect reconstructions (no real particle in 3D), that must be eliminated through tracking or intensity constraints. In an alternative method, 3D Particle Streak Velocimetry (3D-PSV), the exposure time is increased, and the particles' pathlines are imaged as "streaks". We treat these streaks (a) as connected endpoints and (b) as conic section segments and develop a theoretical model that describes the mechanisms of 3D ambiguity generation and shows that streaks can drastically reduce reconstruction ambiguities. Moreover, we propose a method for simultaneously estimating these short, low-curvature conic section segments and their 3D position from multiple camera views.

Specifically, we first show that a traditional convolution with kernel size k x k can be decomposed into k^2 individual 1x1 convolutions, followed by shift and summation operations. Then, we interpret the projections of queries, keys, and values in selfattention module as multiple 1x1 convolutions, followed by the computation of attention weights and aggregation of the values. Therefore, the first stage of both two modules comprises the similar operation. More importantly, the first stage contributes a dominant computation complexity (square of the channel size) comparing to the second stage. This observation naturally leads to an elegant integration of these two seemingly distinct paradigms, i.e., a mixed model that enjoys the benefit of both self-Attention and Convolution (ACmix), while having minimum computational overhead compared to the pure convolution or selfattention counterpart. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves consistently improved results over competitive baselines on image recognition and downstream tasks.

We design our agent using DeiT-distilled and train it with a one-step actor-critic algorithm. Furthermore, to improve classification performance, we introduce a novel training objective, which enforces consistency between the class distribution predicted by a teacher model from a complete image and the class distribution predicted by our agent using glimpses. When the agent senses only 4% of the total image area, the inclusion of the proposed consistency loss in our training objective yields 3% and 8% higher accuracy on ImageNet and fMoW datasets, respectively. Moreover, our agent outperforms previous state-of-the-art by observing nearly 27% and 42% fewer pixels in glimpses on ImageNet and fMoW.}}

Attribute prediction has seen exciting recent progress and is often formulated as a multi-label classification problem. Yet significant challenges remain in: 1) predicting a large number of attributes over multiple object categories, 2) modeling category-dependence of attributes, 3) methodically capturing both global and local scene context, and 4) robustly predicting attributes of objects with low pixel-count. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-category attribute prediction deep architecture named GlideNet, which contains three distinct feature extractors. A global feature extractor recognizes what objects are present in a scene, whereas a local one focuses on the area surrounding the object of interest. Meanwhile, an intrinsic feature extractor uses an extension of standard convolution dubbed Informed Convolution to retrieve features of objects with low pixel-count utilizing its binary mask. GlideNet then uses gating mechanisms with binary masks and its self-learned category embedding to combine the dense embeddings. Collectively, the Global-Local-Intrinsic blocks comprehend the scene's global context while attending to the characteristics of the local object of interest. The architecture adapts the feature composition based on the category via category embedding. Finally, using the combined features, an interpreter predicts the attributes, and the length of the output is determined by the category, thereby removing unnecessary attributes. GlideNet can achieve compelling results on two recent and challenging datasets -- VAW and CAR -- for large-scale attribute prediction. For instance, it obtains more than 5% gain over state of the art in the mean recall (mR) metric. GlideNet's advantages are especially apparent when predicting attributes of objects with low pixel counts as well as attributes that demand global context understanding. Finally, we show that GlideNet excels in training starved real-world scenarios.}}

It further refines the predictions by taking depth estimates into account. We evaluate the proposed model on the Cityscapes and AIODrive datasets. We find difference attention to be particularly suitable for forecasting because the difference of quantities like locations enables a model to explicitly reason about velocities and acceleration.

Miscalibration can be exacerbated by overfitting due to the minimization of the cross-entropy during training, as it promotes the predicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments. This yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is significantly larger than the remaining activations. Recent evidence from the literature suggests that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the entropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. We provide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current state-of-the-art calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed as approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian term) imposing equality constraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such underlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push towards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best compromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model during gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a simple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which imposes a controllable margin on logit distances.

On two large video datasets that we release along with this paper, our experiments show that the representation is able to successfully reveal occlusions for several tasks, without any architectural changes.

While much progress has been in 3D human mesh estimation, existing methods struggle when test input has crowded scenes. The first reason for the failure is a domain gap between training and testing data. A motion capture dataset, which provides accurate 3D labels for training, lacks crowd data and impedes a network from learning crowded scene-robust image features of a target person. The second reason is a feature processing that spatially averages the feature map of a localized bounding box containing multiple people. Averaging the whole feature map makes a target person's feature indistinguishable from others. We present 3DCrowdNet that firstly explicitly targets in-the-wild crowded scenes and estimates a robust 3D human mesh by addressing the above issues. First, we leverage 2D human pose estimation that does not require a motion capture dataset with 3D labels for training and does not suffer from the domain gap. Second, we propose a joint-based regressor that distinguishes a target person's feature from others. Our joint-based regressor preserves the spatial activation of a target by sampling features from the target's joint locations and regresses human model parameters. As a result, 3DCrowdNet learns target-focused features and effectively excludes the irrelevant features of nearby persons. We conduct experiments on various benchmarks and prove the robustness of 3DCrowdNet to the in-the-wild crowded scenes both quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, it goes against the practical applications in the real world which suffer from a heavy class imbalance problem, known as the long-tailed object detection. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Adaptive Hierarchical Representation Learning (AHRL), from a metric learning perspective to address long-tailed object detection. We visualize each learned class representation in the feature space, and observe that some classes, especially under-represented scarce classes, are prone to cluster with analogous ones due to the lack of discriminative representation. Inspired by this, we propose to split the whole feature space into a hierarchical structure and eliminate the problem in a divide-and-conquer way. AHRL contains a two-stage training paradigm. First, we train a normal baseline model and construct the hierarchical structure under the unsupervised clustering method. Then, we design an AHR loss that consists of two optimization objectives. On the one hand, AHR loss retains the hierarchical structure and keeps representation clusters away from each other. On the other hand, AHR loss adopts adaptive margins according to specific class pairs in the same cluster to further optimize locally. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging LVIS dataset and AHRL outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods, with 29.1% segmentation AP and 29.3% box AP on LVIS v0.5 and 27.6% segmentation AP and 28.7% box AP on LVIS v1.0 based on ResNet-101. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline to help stimulate future research in long-tailed object detection. Code will be released soon.}}

The standard solution is to apply the straight-through estimator (STE), using different functions during the inference and gradient computation steps. Several STE variants have been proposed in the literature aiming to maximise the task accuracy of the trained network. In this paper, we analyse STE variants and study their impact on QNN training. We first observe that most such variants can be modelled as stochastic regularisations of stair functions; although this intuitive interpretation is not new, our rigorous discussion generalises to further variants. Then, we analyse QNNs mixing different regularisations, finding that some suitably synchronised smoothing of each layer map is required to guarantee pointwise compositional convergence to the target discontinuous function. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose additive noise annealing (ANA), a new algorithm to train QNNs encompassing standard STE and its variants as special cases. When testing ANA on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark, we find that the major impact on task accuracy is not due to the qualitative shape of the regularisations but to the proper synchronisation of the different STE variants used in a network, in accordance with the theoretical results.}}

That is, not only do state-of-the-art methods, such as normalizing flows, often demonstrate out-performance, but the initial bits required in coding makes single and parallel image compression challenging. To remedy this, we introduce Split Hierarchical Variational Compression (SHVC). SHVC introduces two novelties. Firstly, we propose an efficient autoregressive prior, the autoregressive sub-pixel convolution, that allows a generalisation between per-pixel autoregressions and fully factorised probability models. Secondly, we define our coding framework, the autoregressive initial bits, that flexibly supports parallel coding and avoids -- for the first time -- many of the practicalities commonly associated with bits-back coding. In our experiments, we demonstrate SHVC is able to achieve state-of-the-art compression performance across full-resolution lossless image compression tasks, with up to 100x fewer model parameters than competing VAE approaches.}}

This is a challenging task because dogs exhibit a wide range of shapes and appearances, and are highly articulated. Recent work has proposed to directly regress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from images. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using Classification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we modify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape. But, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from an image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground truth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses that exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact that dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel breed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of dogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The second one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses significantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also compare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our approach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic. This work shows that a-priori information about genetic similarity can help to compensate for the lack of 3D training data.

Often, real-world collections of shapes have symmetries, which can be defined as transformations that do not change the essence of the shape. A natural way to incorporate symmetries in shape space learning is to ask that the mapping to the shape space (encoder) and mapping from the shape space (decoder) are equivariant to the relevant symmetries. In this paper, we present a framework for incorporating equivariance in encoders and decoders by introducing two contributions: (i) adapting the recent Frame Averaging (FA) framework for building generic, efficient, and maximally expressive Equivariant autoencoders; and (ii) constructing autoencoders equivariant to piecewise Euclidean motions applied to different parts of the shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully piecewise Euclidean equivariant autoencoder construction. Training our framework is simple: it uses standard reconstruction losses, and does not require the introduction of new losses. Our architectures are built of standard (backbone) architectures with the appropriate frame averaging to make them equivariant. Testing our framework on both rigid shapes dataset using implicit neural representations, and articulated shape datasets using mesh-based neural networks show state-of-the-art generalization to unseen test shapes, improving relevant baselines by a large margin.

While noticing the capability of discrete representation for complex reasoning and predictive learning, we propose a novel Discrete Latent Transformer (DLFormer) to reformulate video inpainting tasks into the discrete latent space rather the previous continuous feature space. Specifically, we first learn a unique compact discrete codebook and the corresponding autoencoder to represent the target video. Built upon these representative discrete codes obtained from the entire target video, the subsequent discrete latent transformer is capable to infer proper codes for unknown areas under a self-attention mechanism, and thus produces fine-grained content with long-term spatial-temporal consistency. Moreover, we further explicitly enforce the short-term consistency to relieve temporal visual jitters via a temporal aggregation block among adjacent frames. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in reconstructing visually-plausible and spatial-temporal coherent content with fine-grained details}}

CRM continuously aligns the feature map with the refinement target and aggregates features to reconstruct these images' details. Besides, our CRM shows its significant generalization ability to fill the resolution gap between low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing ones. We present quantitative performance evaluation and visualization to show that our proposed method is fast and effective on image segmentation refinement.}}

To address this issue, we propose a novel Meta Distribution Alignment (MDA) method to enable them to share similar distribution in a test-time-training fashion. Specifically, since high-dimensional features are difficult to constrain with a known simple distribution, we first introduce an intermediate latent space constrained to a known prior distribution. The source domain data is mapped to this latent space and then reconstructed back. A meta-learning strategy is introduced to facilitate generalization and support fast adaption. To reduce their discrepancy, we further propose a test-time adaptive updating strategy based on the latent space which efficiently adapts model to unseen domains with a few samples.

Such limitations have led to increased interest in domain generalization (DG) approaches that improve the ability of models learned from a single or multiple source domains to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) test domains. In this work, we propose BoosterNet, a lean add-on network that can be simply appended to any arbitrary core network to improve its generalization capability without requiring any changes in its architecture or training procedure. Specifically, using a novel measure of feature culpability, BoosterNet is trained episodically on the most and least culpable data features extracted from critical units in the core network based on their contribution towards class-specific prediction errors, which have shown to improve generalization. At inference time, corresponding test image features are extracted from the closest class-specific units, determined by smart gating via a Siamese network, and fed to BoosterNet for improved generalization. We evaluate the performance of BoosterNet within two very different classification problems, digits and skin lesions, and demonstrate a marked improvement in model generalization to OOD test domains compared to SOTA.}}

However, the capacities largely come from high-quality annotated labels, which are expensive to collect. Noisy labels are more affordable, but result in corrupted representations, leading to poor generalization performance. To learn robust representations and handle noisy labels, we propose selective-supervised contrastive learning (Sel-CL) in this paper. Specifically, Sel-CL extend supervised contrastive learning (Sup-CL), which is powerful in representation learning, but is degraded when there are noisy labels. Sel-CL tackles the direct cause of the problem of Sup-CL. That is, as Sup-CL works in a pair-wise manner, noisy pairs built by noisy labels mislead representation learning. To alleviate the issue, we select confident pairs out of noisy ones for Sup-CL without knowing noise rates. In the selection process, by measuring the agreement between learned representations and given labels, we first identify confident examples that are exploited to build confident pairs. Then, the representation similarity distribution in the built confident pairs is exploited to identify more confident pairs out of noisy pairs. All obtained confident pairs are finally used for Sup-CL to enhance representations. Experiments on multiple noisy datasets demonstrate the robustness of the learned representations by our method, following the state-of-the-art performance.

Most of them exploit single visual cues of tabular elements or simply combine visual cues with other modalities via early fusion to reason their graph relationships. However, neither early fusion nor individually reasoning in terms of multiple modalities can be appropriate for all varieties of table structures with great diversity. Instead, different modalities are expected to collaborate with each other in different patterns for different table cases. In the community, the importance of intra-inter modality interactions for table structure reasoning is still unexplored. In this paper, we define it as heterogeneous table structure recognition (Hetero-TSR) problem. With the aim of filling this gap, we present a novel Neural Collaborative Graph Machines (NCGM) equipped with stacked collaborative blocks, which alternatively extracts intra-modality context and models inter-modality interactions in a hierarchical way. It can represent the intra-inter modality relationships of tabular elements more robustly, which significantly improves the recognition performance. We also show that the proposed NCGM can modulate collaborative pattern of different modalities conditioned on the context of intra-modality cues, which is vital for diversified table cases.

To empower an agent with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction and egocentric object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object and transferring it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as supervision.

Specifically, an Affordance Invariance Mining module is devised to extract specific clues by minimizing the intra-class differences originated from interaction habits in exocentric images.

The core idea comes from the observation that i) semantic information of foreground objects usually differs from their backgrounds; ii) foreground objects with similar appearance or background with similar color/texture have similar representations in the feature space. We form the positive and negative pairs based on the above relations and force the network to disentangle foreground and background with a class-agnostic activation map using a novel contrastive loss. As the network is guided to discriminate cross-image foreground-background, the class-agnostic activation maps learned by our approach generate more complete object regions. We successfully extracted from C^2AM class-agnostic object bounding boxes for object localization and background cues to refine CAM generated by classification network for semantic segmentation.

They can converge poorly and thereby suffer from performance degradation. To combat these drawbacks, we propose deep equilibrium (DEQ) flow estimators, an approach that directly solves for the flow as the infinite-level fixed point of an implicit layer (using any black-box solver), and differentiates through this fixed point analytically (thus requiring O(1) training memory). This implicit-depth approach is not predicated on any specific model, and thus can be applied to a wide range of SOTA flow estimation model designs (e.g., RAFT and GMA). The use of these DEQ flow estimators allows us to compute the flow faster using, e.g., fixed-point reuse and inexact gradients, consumes 4-6x less training memory than the recurrent counterpart, and achieves better results with the same computation budget. In addition, we propose a novel, sparse fixed-point correction scheme to stabilize our DEQ flow estimators, which addresses a longstanding challenge for DEQ models in general. We test our approach in various realistic settings and show that it improves SOTA methods on Sintel and KITTI datasets with substantially better computational and memory efficiency.}}

We find that understanding of event temporality is often not necessary to achieve strong or state-of-the-art performance, even compared with recent large-scale video-language models and in contexts intended to benchmark deeper video-level understanding. We also demonstrate how ATP can improve both video-language dataset and model design. We describe a technique for leveraging ATP to better disentangle dataset subsets with a higher concentration of temporally challenging data, improving benchmarking efficacy for causal and temporal understanding. Further, we show that effectively integrating ATP into full video-level temporal models can improve efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.}}

When jointly trained with a deep super-resolution (SR) architecture, LTE is capable of characterizing image textures in 2D Fourier space. We show that an LTE-based neural function achieves favorable performance against existing deep SR methods within an arbitrary-scale factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our implementation takes the shortest running time compared to previous works.}}

Learning models on event-based object classification have recently achieved massive success by accumulating sparse events into dense frames to apply traditional 2D learning methods.

This study aims to address the core problem of balancing accuracy and model complexity for event-based classification models. To this end, we introduce a novel graph representation for event data to exploit their sparsity better and customize a lightweight voxel graph convolutional neural network (EV-VGCNN) for event-based classification. Specifically, (1) using voxel-wise vertices rather than previous point-wise inputs to explicitly exploit regional 2D semantics of event streams while keeping the sparsity; (2) proposing a multi-scale feature relational layer (MFRL) to extract spatial and motion cues from each vertex discriminatively concerning its distances to neighbors.

Most of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches ignore the usage of scene text information and directly adding this information may lead to performance degradation in scene text free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a full transformer architecture to unify these cross-modal retrieval scenarios in a single Vision and Scene Text Aggregation framework (ViSTA). Specifically, ViSTA utilizes transformer blocks to directly encode image patches and fuse scene text embedding to learn an aggregated visual representation for cross-modal retrieval. To tackle the modality missing problem of scene text, we propose a novel fusion token based transformer aggregation approach to exchange the necessary scene text information only through the fusion token and concentrate on the most important features in each modality. To further strengthen the visual modality, we develop dual contrastive learning losses to embed both image-text pairs and fusion-text pairs into a common cross-modal space. Compared to existing methods, ViSTA enables to aggregate relevant scene text semantics with visual appearance, and hence improve results under both scene text free and scene text aware scenarios. Experimental results show that ViSTA outperforms other methods by at least 8.4% at Recall@1 for scene text aware retrieval task. Compared with state-of-the-art scene text free retrieval methods, ViSTA can achieve better accuracy on Flicker30K and MSCOCO while running at least three times faster during the inference stage, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}}

Hence, the final score should be determined by the comprehensive effect of different grades exhibited in the video. To explore this latent relationship, we design a novel Likert scoring paradigm inspired by the Likert scale in psychometrics, in which we quantify the grades explicitly and generate the final quality score by combining the quantitative values and the corresponding responses estimated from the video, instead of performing direct regression. Moreover, we extract gradespecific features, which will be used to estimate the responses of each grade, through a Transformer decoder architecture with diverse learnable queries. The whole model is named as Grade-decoupling Likert Transformer (GDLT), and we achieve state-of-the-art results on two long-term action assessment datasets.}}

Yet due to the inherent challenges of motion estimation (e.g. occlusions and discontinuities), most state-of-the-art interpolation approaches require subsequent refinement of the warped result to generate satisfying outputs, which drastically decreases the efficiency for multi-frame interpolation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable Many-to-Many (M2M) splatting framework to interpolate frames efficiently. Specifically, given a frame pair, we estimate multiple bidirectional flows to directly forward warp the pixels to the desired time step, and then fuse any overlapping pixels. In doing so, each source pixel renders multiple target pixels and each target pixel can be synthesized from a larger area of visual context. This establishes a many-to-many splatting scheme with robustness to artifacts like holes. Moreover, for each input frame pair, M2M only performs motion estimation once and has a minuscule computational overhead when interpolating an arbitrary number of in-between frames, hence achieving fast multi-frame interpolation. We conducted extensive experiments to analyze M2M, and found that it significantly improves the efficiency while maintaining high effectiveness.}}

Existing NAS-based meta-learning methods apply a two-stage strategy, i.e., first searching architectures and then re-training meta-weights on the searched architecture. However, this two-stage strategy would break the mutual impact of the architecture and meta-weights since they are optimized separately. Differently, we propose progressive connection consolidation, fixing the architecture layer by layer, in which the layer with the largest weight value would be fixed first. In this way, we can jointly search architectures and train the meta-weights on fixed layers. Besides, to improve the generalization performance of the searched meta-learner on all tasks, we propose a more effective rule for co-optimization, namely Connection-Adaptive Meta-learning (CAML). By searching only once, we can obtain both adaptive architecture and meta-weights for meta-learning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3x less computational cost, revealing our method's effectiveness and efficiency.}}

Earlier works follow a top-down roadmap to regress predefined anchors into various shapes of lane lines, which lacks enough flexibility to fit complex shapes of lanes due to the fixed anchor shapes. Lately, some works propose to formulate lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem to describe the shapes of lane lines more flexibly and gradually group adjacent keypoints belonging to the same lane line in a point-by-point manner, which is inefficient and time-consuming during postprocessing. In this paper, we propose a Global Association Network (GANet) to formulate the lane detection problem from a new perspective, where each keypoint is directly regressed to the starting point of the lane line instead of point-by-point extension. Concretely, the association of keypoints to their belonged lane line is conducted by predicting their offsets to the corresponding starting points of lanes globally without dependence on each other, which could be done in parallel to greatly improve efficiency. In addition, we further propose a Lane-aware Feature Aggregator (LFA), which adaptively captures the local correlations between adjacent keypoints to supplement local information to the global association.

In this paper, we introduce a few-shot incremental learning method for label-to-image translation. It learns new classes one by one from a few samples of each class. We propose to adopt semantically-adaptive convolution filters and normalization. When incrementally trained on a novel semantic class, the model only learns a few extra parameters of class-specific modulation. Such design avoids catastrophic forgetting of already-learned semantic classes and enables label-to-image translation of scenes with increasingly rich content. Furthermore, to facilitate few-shot learning, we propose a modulation transfer strategy for better initialization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing related methods in most cases and achieves zero forgetting.}}

However, MRI suffers from very long acquisition times that make it susceptible to patient motion artifacts and limit its potential to deliver dynamic treatments. Conventional approaches such as Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing allow for an increase in MRI acquisition speed by reconstructing MR images from sub-sampled MRI data acquired using multiple receiver coils. Recent advancements in Deep Learning combined with Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing techniques have the potential to produce high-fidelity reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI data. In this work we present a novel Deep Learning-based Inverse Problem solver applied to the task of Accelerated MRI Reconstruction, called the Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet), by exploiting the properties of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks and unrolled algorithms for solving Inverse Problems. The RecurrentVarNet consists of multiple recurrent blocks, each responsible for one iteration of the unrolled variational optimization scheme for solving the inverse problem of multi-coil Accelerated MRI Reconstruction. Contrary to traditional approaches, the optimization steps are performed in the observation domain (k-space) instead of the image domain. Each block of the RecurrentVarNet refines the observed k-space and comprises a data consistency term and a recurrent unit which takes as input a learned hidden state and the prediction of the previous block. Our proposed method achieves new state of the art qualitative and quantitative reconstruction results on 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data from a public multi-coil brain dataset, outperforming previous conventional and deep learning-based approaches.

This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations between these two tasks, thus failing to exploit handy instance-level semantic cues to boost depth accuracy while also producing sub-optimal depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by applying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction tasks. Specifically, instead of predicting depth for all pixels at a time, we generate instance-specific kernels to predict depth and segmentation masks for each instance. Moreover, leveraging the instance-wise depth estimation scheme, we add additional instance-level depth cues to assist with supervising the depth learning via a new depth loss. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes-DPS and SemKITTI-DPS show the effectiveness and promise of our method. We hope our unified solution to DPS can lead a new paradigm in this area.}}

So far, most of the previous methods still struggle to extract semantic attributes for 3D reconstruction task. Since the semantic attributes of a single image are usually implicit and entangled with each other, it is still challenging to reconstruct 3D shape with detailed semantic structures represented by the input image. To address this problem, we propose 3DAttriFlow to disentangle and extract semantic attributes through different semantic levels in the input images. These disentangled semantic attributes will be integrated into the 3D shape reconstruction process, which can provide definite guidance to the reconstruction of specific attribute on 3D shape. As a result, the 3D decoder can explicitly capture high-level semantic features at the bottom of the network, and utilize low-level features at the top of the network, which allows to reconstruct more accurate 3D shapes. Note that the explicit disentangling is learned without extra labels, where the only supervision used in our training is the input image and its corresponding 3D shape. Our comprehensive experiments on ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that 3DAttriFlow outperforms the state-of-the-art shape reconstruction methods, and we also validate its generalization ability on shape completion task.

With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method, classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios, and experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

Second, background class contains complex context, which results in false alarms due to large background intra-class variance. To alleviate these two issues, we construct a sparse and complete latent structure via prototypes. In particular, to enhance the sparsity of the latent space, we design a prototypical contrastive learning to have prototypes of the same category clustering together and prototypes of different categories to be far away from each other. Also, we strengthen the completeness of the latent space by modeling all foreground categories and hardest (nearest) background objects. We further design a patch shuffle augmentation for remote sensing images with complicated contexts. Our augmentation encourages the semantic information of an object to be correlated only to the limited context within the patch that is specific to its category, which further reduces large intra-class variance.

We apply this method in a face recognition setup. We show that certain weaknesses of models trained on real data can be discovered using simulated samples. Using our proposed method, we can find adversarial synthetic faces that fool contemporary face recognition models. This demonstrates the fact that these models have weaknesses that are not measured by commonly used validation datasets. We hypothesize that this type of adversarial examples are not isolated, but usually lie in connected spaces in the latent space of the simulator. We present a method to find these adversarial regions as opposed to the typical adversarial points found in the adversarial example literature.}}

However, these assumptions do not always hold in practical applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a depth solving system that fully explores the visual clues from the subtasks in M3OD and generates multiple estimations for the depth of each target. Since the depth estimations rely on different assumptions in essence, they present diverse distributions. Even if some assumptions collapse, the estimations established on the remaining assumptions are still reliable. In addition, we develop a depth selection and combination strategy. This strategy is able to remove abnormal estimations caused by collapsed assumptions, and adaptively combine the remaining estimations into a single one. In this way, our depth solving system becomes more precise and robust.

The proposed method can handle the signal-dependent noise in the inputs, process sequences of any length, and be robust to inaccuracies in the exposure times. Furthermore, it can be trained end-to-end with self-supervision, without requiring ground truth high resolution frames, which makes it especially suited to handle real data. Central to our method are three key contributions: i) a base-detail decomposition for handling errors in the exposure times, ii) a noise-level-aware feature encoding for improved fusion of frames with varying signal-to-noise ratio and iii) a permutation invariant fusion strategy by temporal pooling operators. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms by a significant margin existing single-exposure approaches that we adapted to the multi-exposure case.}}

However, due to the number of subjects and objects involved in these indoor datasets being limited, the learned contact patterns could not generalize easily. Our key idea is to reconstruct the contact pattern directly from monocular images and utilize the physical stability criterion in the simulation to drive the optimization process described above. This criterion is defined by the resultant forces and contact distribution computed by the physics engine. Compared to existing solutions, our framework can be adapted to more personalized hands and diverse object shapes. Furthermore, we create an interaction dataset with extra physical attributes to verify the sim-to-real consistency of our methods. Through comprehensive evaluations, hand-object contact can be reconstructed with both accuracy and stability by the proposed framework.}}

As such, these methods are not able to deal with common real-world scenarios that involve background frames or videos that contain non-monotonic sequence of actions. In this paper, we propose an approach to align sequential actions in the wild that involve diverse temporal variations.

We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel strategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed optimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a 'coreset' that closely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to current model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective application to the continual learning setting.

In this paper, we decouple a color image to two main components, a gray image and a color hist histogram. Further, we employ these two components to guide the enhancement, where the gray image is used to generate reasonable structures and textures and the corresponding color histogram is beneficial to keeping color consistency. To reduce the gap between images and color histograms, we also develop a pyramid color embedding (PCE) module, which can better embed the color information to the enhancement process according to the affinity between images and color histograms.

Hence, we propose a simple yet effective Dynamically Optimized Pooling operation, referred to as DynOPool, which learns the optimized scale factors of feature maps end-to-end. Moreover, DynOPool determines the proper resolution of a feature map by learning the desirable size and shape of its receptive field, which allows an operator in a deeper layer to observe an input image in the optimal scale. Any kind of resizing modules in a deep neural network can be replaced by DynOPool with minimal cost.

This comes with major limitations. For example, it is problematic for a model conditioned on an image to generate a specific motion trajectory desired by the user since there is no means to provide motion information. Conversely, language information can describe the desired motion, while not precisely defining the content of the video. This work presents a multimodal video generation framework that benefits from text and images provided jointly or separately. We leverage the recent progress in quantized representations for videos and apply a bidirectional transformer with multiple modalities as inputs to predict a discrete video representation. To improve video quality and consistency, we propose a new video token trained with self-learning and an improved mask-prediction algorithm for sampling video tokens. We introduce text augmentation to improve the robustness of the textual representation and diversity of generated videos. Our framework can incorporate various visual modalities, such as segmentation masks, drawings, and partially occluded images. It can generate much longer sequences than the one used for training. In addition, our model can extract visual information as suggested by the text prompt, e.g., "an object in image one is moving northeast", and generate corresponding videos.

In this paper, inspired by belief propagation (BP), we propose the Confidence Propagation Cluster (CP-Cluster) to replace NMS-based methods, which is fully parallelizable as well as better in accuracy. In CP-Cluster, we borrow the message passing mechanism from BP to penalize redundant boxes and enhance true positives simultaneously in an iterative way until convergence. We verified the effectiveness of CP-Cluster by applying it to various mainstream detectors such as FasterRCNN, SSD, FCOS, YOLOv3, YOLOv5, Centernet etc. Experiments on MS COCO show that our plug and play method, without retraining detectors, is able to steadily improve average mAP of all those state-of-theart models with a clear margin from 0.3 to 1.9 respectively when compared with NMS-based methods.}}

How to detect the precise shape information of infrared targets remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel infrared shape network (ISNet), where Taylor finite difference (TFD)-inspired edge block and two-orientation attention aggregation (TOAA) block are devised to address this problem. Specifically, TFD-inspired edge block aggregates and enhances the comprehensive edge information from different levels, in order to improve the contrast between target and background and also lay a foundation for extracting shape information with mathematical interpretation. TOAA block calculates the low-level information with attention mechanism in both row and column directions and fuses it with the high-level information to capture the shape characteristic of targets and suppress noises. In addition, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 1,000 realistic images in various target shapes, different target sizes, and rich clutter backgrounds with accurate pixel-level annotations, called IRSTD-1k.

In light of this prototype view, this study uncovers several limitations of such parametric segmentation regime, and proposes a nonparametric alternative based on non-learnable prototypes. Instead of prior methods learning a single weight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model represents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on the mean features of several training pixels within that class. The dense prediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This allows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the arrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to handle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable parameters.We empirically show that, with FCN based and attention based segmentation models (i.e., HRNet, Swin, SegFormer) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet, Swin, MiT), our nonparametric framework yields compelling results over several datasets (i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff), and performs well in the large-vocabulary situation.

Each model can thus benefit from its counterpart by utilizing cross-model predictions as supervision.

To this end, we propose to learn pixel-level distinctions to improve the video highlight detection. This pixel-level distinction indicates whether or not each pixel in one video belongs to an interesting section. The advantages of modeling such fine-level distinctions are two-fold. First, it allows us to exploit the temporal and spatial relations of the content in one video, since the distinction of a pixel in one frame is highly dependent on both the content before this frame and the content around this pixel in this frame. Second, learning the pixel-level distinction also gives a good explanation to the video highlight task regarding what contents in a highlight segment will be attractive to people.

Here, we reveal that Tweedie distributions also play key roles in modern deep learning era, leading to a distribution independent self-supervised image denoising formula without clean reference images. Specifically, by combining with the recent Noise2Score self-supervised image denoising approach and the saddle point approximation of Tweedie distribution, we can provide a general closed-form denoising formula that can be used for large classes of noise distributions without ever knowing the underlying noise distribution. Similar to the original Noise2Score, the new approach is composed of two successive steps: score matching using perturbed noisy images, followed by a closed form image denoising formula via distribution-independent Tweedie's formula. This also suggests a systematic algorithm to estimate the noise model and noise parameters for a given noisy image data set. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate noise models and parameters, and provide the state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance in the benchmark dataset and real-world dataset.}}

The global similarity, however, has the problems of the lack of locality and the high computational complexity that is quadratic to an input resolution. The local attention mechanism alleviates these issues by introducing the inductive bias of the locality with convolution-like operators. However, by focusing only on adjacent positions, the local attention suffers from an insufficient receptive field for image restoration. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism for image restoration, called k-NN Image Transformer (KiT), that rectifies above mentioned limitations. Specifically, the KiT groups k-nearest neighbor patches with locality sensitive hashing (LSH), and the grouped patches are aggregated into each query patch by performing a pair-wise local attention. In this way, the pair-wise operation establishes non-local connectivity while maintaining the desired properties of the local attention, i.e., inductive bias of locality and linear complexity to input resolution. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art restoration approaches on image denoising, deblurring and deraining benchmarks.

In this paper, a Character-Context Decoupling framework is proposed to alleviate this problem by separating contextual information and character-visual information. Contextual information can be decomposed into temporal information and linguistic information. Here, temporal information that models character order and word length is isolated with a detached temporal attention module. Linguistic information that models n-gram and other linguistic statistics is separated with a decoupled context anchor mechanism. A variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method achieves promising performance on open-set, zero-shot, and close-set text recognition datasets.}}

Our method is based on a shared mask generator, which separates the foreground object from its background, and captures the object's general pose and shape. To control the source of the identity of the output frame, we employ perturbations to interrupt the unwanted identity information on the driver's mask. A mask-refinement module then replaces the identity of the driver with the identity of the source. Conditioned on the source image, the transformed mask is then decoded by a multi-scale generator that renders a realistic image, in which the content of the source frame is animated by the pose in the driving video. Due to the lack of fully supervised data, we train on the task of reconstructing frames from the same video the source image is taken from.

A novel Shuffled Style Assembly Network (SSAN) is proposed to extract and reassemble different content and style features for a stylized feature space. Then, to obtain a generalized representation, a contrastive learning strategy is developed to emphasize liveness-related style information while suppress the domain-specific one. Finally, the representations of the correct assemblies are used to distinguish between living and spoofing during the inferring. On the other hand, despite the decent performance, there still exists a gap between academia and industry, due to the difference in data quantity and distribution.

Given an image depicting a hand-held object, we first use off-the-shelf systems to estimate the underlying hand pose and then infer the object shape in a normalized hand-centric coordinate frame. We parameterized the object by signed distance which is inferred by an implicit network that leverages the information from both visual feature and articulation-aware coordinates to process a query point.

Unfortunately, with the propagation of binary spikes, the distribution of membrane potential will shift, leading to degeneration, saturation, and gradient mismatch problems, which would be disadvantageous to the network optimization and convergence. Such undesired shifts would prevent the SNN from performing well and going deep. To tackle these problems, we attempt to rectify the membrane potential distribution (MPD) by designing a novel distribution loss, MPD-Loss, which can explicitly penalize the undesired shifts without introducing any additional operations in the inference phase. Moreover, the proposed method can also mitigate the quantization error in SNNs, which is usually ignored in other works.

This contact is a vital source of information for understanding 3D humans, 3D scenes, and the interactions between them. In fact, we demonstrate that these human-scene interactions (HSIs) can be leveraged to improve the 3D reconstruction of a scene from a monocular RGB video. Our key idea is that, as a person moves through a scene and interacts with it, we accumulate HSIs across multiple input images, and use these in optimizing the 3D scene to reconstruct a consistent, physically plausible, 3D scene layout. Our optimization-based approach exploits three types of HSI constraints: (1) humans who move in a scene are occluded by, or occlude, objects, thus constraining the depth ordering of the objects, (2) humans move through free space and do not interpenetrate objects, (3) when humans and objects are in contact, the contact surfaces occupy the same place in space. Using these constraints in an optimization formulation across all observations, we significantly improve 3D scene layout reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that our scene reconstruction can be used to refine the initial 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation. We evaluate the 3D scene layout reconstruction and HPS estimates qualitatively and quantitatively using the PROX and PiGraphs datasets.

However, videos inherently express a much wider gamut of information than texts. Instead, texts often capture sub-regions of entire videos and are most semantically similar to certain frames within videos. Therefore, for a given text, a retrieval model should focus on the text's most semantically similar video sub-regions to make a more relevant comparison. Yet, most existing works aggregate entire videos without directly considering text. Common text-agnostic aggregations schemes include mean-pooling or self-attention over the frames, but these are likely to encode misleading visual information not described in the given text. To address this, we propose a cross-modal attention model called X-Pool that reasons between a text and the frames of a video. Our core mechanism is a scaled dot product attention for a text to attend to its most semantically similar frames. We then generate an aggregated video representation conditioned on the text's attention weights over the frames. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD and LSMDC, achieving new state-of-the-art results by up to 12% in relative improvement in Recall@1. Our findings thereby highlight the importance of joint text-video reasoning to extract important visual cues according to text.

Instead of sequentially scanning a scene and directly recording depth via the photon time-of-flight, as in pulsed LiDAR sensors, gated imagers encode depth in the relative intensity of a handful of gated slices, captured at megapixel resolution. Although existing methods have shown that it is possible to decode high-resolution depth from such measurements, these methods require synchronized and calibrated LiDAR to supervise the gated depth decoder - prohibiting fast adoption across geographies, training on large unpaired datasets, and exploring alternative applications outside of automotive use cases. In this work, we fill this gap and propose an entirely self-supervised depth estimation method that uses gated intensity profiles and temporal consistency as a training signal. The proposed model is trained end-to-end from gated video sequences, does not require LiDAR or RGB data, and learns to estimate absolute depth values. We take gated slices as input and disentangle the estimation of the scene albedo, depth, and ambient light, which are then used to learn to reconstruct the input slices through a cyclic loss. We rely on temporal consistency between a given frame and neighboring gated slices to estimate depth in regions with shadows and reflections. We experimentally validate that the proposed approach outperforms existing supervised and self-supervised depth estimation methods based on monocular RGB and stereo images, as well as supervised methods based on gated images.}}

Reconstruction learning over real images enhances the learned representations to be aware of forgery patterns that are even unknown, while classification learning takes the charge of mining the essential discrepancy between real and fake images, facilitating the understanding of forgeries. To achieve better representations, instead of only using the encoder in reconstruction learning, we build bipartite graphs over the encoder and decoder features in a multi-scale fashion. We further exploit the reconstruction difference as guidance of forgery traces on the graph output as the final representation, which is fed into the classifier for forgery detection. The reconstruction and classification learning is optimized end-to-end.

To leverage this insight, we model the object parts in 3D as ellipsoids, which allows us to identify joints.

Experiments in image classification demonstrate that our proposed formulation results in a significant speed up over optimizing the original MCR2 objective directly and often results in higher quality learned representations.

In contrast, we redefine the HGT detection task as detecting human head locations and their gaze targets, simultaneously. By this way, our method, named Human-Gaze-Target detection TRansformer or HGTTR, streamlines the HGT detection pipeline by eliminating all other additional components. HGTTR reasons about the relations of salient objects and human gaze from the global image context.

The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method are verified with extensive experiments on the two standard benchmark datasets, GazeFollowing and VideoAttentionTarget. Without bells and whistles, HGTTR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins (6.4 mAP gain on GazeFollowing and 10.3 mAP gain on VideoAttentionTarget) with a much simpler architecture.}}

Thanks to the semantic diversity of natural language descriptions, temporal grounding allows activity grounding beyond pre-defined classes and has received increasing attention in recent years. The semantic diversity is rooted in the principle of compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be systematically described by combining known words in novel ways (compositional generalization). However, current temporal grounding datasets do not specifically test for the compositional generalizability. To systematically measure the compositional generalizability of temporal grounding models, we introduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and construct two new dataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. Evaluating the state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we empirically find that they fail to generalize to queries with novel combinations of seen words. To tackle this challenge, we propose a variational cross-graph reasoning framework that explicitly decomposes video and language into multiple structured hierarchies and learns fine-grained semantic correspondence among them. Experiments illustrate the superior compositional generalizability of our approach.}}

In a similar spirit, we propose an end-to-end attention model for action anticipation, dubbed Future Transformer (FUTR), that leverages global attention over all input frames and output tokens to predict a minutes-long sequence of future actions. Unlike the previous autoregressive models, the proposed method learns to predict the whole sequence of future actions in parallel decoding, enabling more accurate and fast inference for long-term anticipation.

However, without the paired data as the supervision, learning a SID network is challenging. Moreover, simply using existing unpaired learning methods (e.g., unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency constraints) in the SID task is insufficient to learn the underlying relationship from rainy inputs to clean outputs as there exists significant domain gap between the rainy and clean images. In this paper, we develop an effective unpaired SID adversarial framework which explores mutual properties of the unpaired exemplars by a dual contrastive learning manner in a deep feature space, named as DCD-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two cooperative branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive Guidance Branch (CGB). Specifically, BTB exploits full advantage of the circulatory architecture of adversarial consistency to generate abundant exemplar pairs and excavates latent feature distributions between two domains by equipping it with bidirectional mapping. Simultaneously, CGB implicitly constrains the embeddings of different exemplars in the deep feature space by encouraging the similar feature distributions closer while pushing the dissimilar further away, in order to better facilitate rain removal and help image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against existing unpaired deraining approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and generates comparable results against several fully-supervised or semi-supervised models.}}

Despite the increasing popularity of sensor fusion in this field, the robustness against inferior image conditions, e.g., bad illumination and sensor misalignment, is under-explored. Existing fusion methods are easily affected by such conditions, mainly due to a hard association of LiDAR points and image pixels, established by calibration matrices. We propose TransFusion, a robust solution to LiDAR-camera fusion with a soft-association mechanism to handle inferior image conditions. Specifically, our TransFusion consists of convolutional backbones and a detection head based on a transformer decoder. The first layer of the decoder predicts initial bounding boxes from a LiDAR point cloud using a sparse set of object queries, and its second decoder layer adaptively fuses the object queries with useful image features, leveraging both spatial and contextual relationships. The attention mechanism of the transformer enables our model to adaptively determine where and what information should be taken from the image, leading to a robust and effective fusion strategy. We additionally design an image-guided query initialization strategy to deal with objects that are difficult to detect in point clouds. TransFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate its robustness against degenerated image quality and calibration errors.

Nevertheless, most of existing models suffer from low interpretability of the predicted actions. Inspired by the observation that temporally-configured human-object interactions often serve as a key indicator of many actions, this work crafts an action reasoning framework that performs Markov Logic Network (MLN) based probabilistic logical inference. Crucially, we propose to encode an action by first-order logical rules that correspond to the temporal changes of visual relationships in videos. The main contributions of this work are two-fold: 1) Different from existing black-box models, the proposed model simultaneously implements the localization of temporal boundaries and the recognition of action categories by grounding the logical rules of MLN in videos. The weight associated with each such rule further provides an estimate of confidence. These collectively make our model more explainable and robust. 2) Instead of using hand-crafted logical rules in conventional MLN, we develop a data-driven instantiation of the MLN. In specific, a hybrid learning scheme is proposed. It combines MLN's weight learning and reinforcement learning, using the former's results as a self-critic for guiding the latter's training. Additionally, by treating actions as logical predicates, the proposed framework can also be integrated with deep models for further performance boost. Comprehensive experiments on two complex video action datasets (Charades & CAD-120) clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of our proposed method.}}

In this per-clip inference scheme, we update the memory with an interval and simultaneously process a set of consecutive frames (i.e. clip) between the memory updates. The scheme provides two potential benefits: accuracy gain by clip-level optimization and efficiency gain by parallel computation of multiple frames. To this end, we propose a new method tailored for the per-clip inference. Specifically, we first introduce a clip-wise operation to refine the features based on intra-clip correlation. In addition, we employ a progressive matching mechanism for efficient information-passing within a clip. With the synergy of two modules and a newly proposed per-clip based training, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on Youtube-VOS 2018/2019 val (84.6% and 84.6%) and DAVIS 2016/2017 val (91.9% and 86.1%).

As for video semantic segmentation, the contexts include static contexts and motional contexts, corresponding to static content and moving content in a video clip, respectively. The static contexts are well exploited in image semantic segmentation by learning multi-scale and global/long-range features. The motional contexts are studied in previous video semantic segmentation. However, there is no research about how to simultaneously learn static and motional contexts which are highly correlated and complementary to each other. To address this problem, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM) technique to learn a unified presentation of static contexts and motional contexts. This technique consists of two parts: coarse-to-fine feature assembling and cross-frame feature mining. The former operation prepares data for further processing, enabling the subsequent joint learning of static and motional contexts. The latter operation mines useful information/contexts from the sequential frames to enhance the video contexts of the features of the target frame. The enhanced features can be directly applied for the final prediction. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CFFM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods for video semantic segmentation.

As a result, the generated images usually contain artifacts or the filled pixels differ greatly from the ground truth, making them far from real-world applications. Image-level predictive filtering is a widely used restoration technique by predicting suitable kernels adaptively according to different input scenes. Inspired by this inherent advantage, we explore the possibility of addressing image inpainting as a filtering task. To this end, we first study the advantages and challenges of the image-level predictive filtering for inpainting: the method can preserve local structures and avoid artifacts but fails to fill large missing areas. Then, we propose the semantic filtering by conducting filtering on deep feature level, which fills the missing semantic information but fails to recover the details. To address the issues while adopting the respective advantages, we propose a novel filtering technique, i.e., Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF) containing two branches: kernel prediction branch (KPB) and semantic & image filtering branch (SIFB). These two branches are interactively linked: SIFB provides multi-level features for KPB while KPB predicts dynamic kernels for SIFB. As a result, the final method takes the advantage of effective semantic & image-level filling for high-fidelity inpainting. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between MISF and the naive encoder-decoder-based inpainting, inferring that MISF provides novel dynamic convolutional operations to enhance the high generalization capability across scenes.

This method adopts Dynamic Class Pool (DCP) for storing and updating the identities' features dynamically, which could be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer. DCP is efficiently time-saving and cost-saving, as its smaller size with the independence from the whole face identities together. We further validate the proposed F2C method across several face benchmarks and private datasets, and display comparable results, meanwhile the speed is faster than state-of-the-art FC-based methods in terms of recognition accuracy and hardware costs.

This approach, however, is not optimal when the temporal distance between the input sequence increases as existing motion estimation modules cannot effectively handle large motions. Hence, VFI works perform well for small frame gaps and perform poorly as the frame gap increases. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address this problem. We argue that when there is a large gap between inputs, instead of estimating imprecise motion that will eventually lead to inaccurate interpolation, we can safely propagate from one side of the input up to a reliable time frame using the other input as a reference. Then, the rest of the intermediate frames can be interpolated using standard approaches as the temporal gap is now narrowed. To this end, we propose a propagation network (PNet) by extending the classic feature-level forecasting with a novel motion-to-feature approach. To be thorough, we adopt a simple interpolation model along with PNet as our full model and design a simple procedure to train the full model in an end-to-end manner.

On top of those stylized spatio-temporal computational units, further refining the learnt feature with axial contexts is demonstrated to be promising in achieving this goal. However, previous works generally focus on utilizing a single kind of contexts to calibrate entire feature channels and could hardly apply to deal with diverse video activities. The problem can be tackled by using pair-wise spatio-temporal attentions to recompute feature response with cross-axis contexts at the expense of heavy computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature refinement method that decomposes the feature channels into several groups and separately refines them with different axial contexts in parallel. We refer this lightweight feature calibration as group contextualization (GC). Specifically, we design a family of efficient element-wise calibrators, i.e., ECal-G/S/T/L, where their axial contexts are information dynamics aggregated from other axes either globally or locally, to contextualize feature channel groups. The GC module can be densely plugged into each residual layer of the off-the-shelf video networks. With little computational overhead, consistent improvement is observed when plugging in GC on different networks. By utilizing calibrators to embed feature with four different kinds of contexts in parallel, the learnt representation is expected to be more resilient to diverse types of activities. On videos with rich temporal variations, empirically GC can boost the performance of 2D-CNN (e.g., TSN and TSM) to a level comparable to the state-of-the-art video networks.

Towards Single-DGOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant representations (DIR) containing intrinsical object characteristics, which is beneficial for improving the robustness for unseen domains. Thus, we present a method, i.e., cyclic-disentangled self-distillation, to disentangle DIR from domain-specific representations without the supervision of domain-related annotations (e.g., domain labels). Concretely, a cyclic-disentangled module is first proposed to cyclically extract DIR from the input visual features. Through the cyclic operation, the disentangled ability can be promoted without the reliance on domain-related annotations. Then, taking the DIR as the teacher, we design a self-distillation module to further enhance the generalization ability. In the experiments, our method is evaluated in urban-scene object detection. Experimental results of five weather conditions show that our method obtains a significant performance gain over baseline methods.

Secondly, in fact, they are only partially based on Bayesian deep learning, as their overall architectures are not designed under the Bayesian framework. However, unifying the overall architecture under the Bayesian perspective can make the architecture have a rigorous theoretical basis, so that each part of the architecture can have a clear probabilistic interpretation. Therefore, to solve the problems, we propose a new generative Bayesian deep learning (GBDL) architecture. GBDL belongs to the generative models, whose target is to estimate the joint distribution of input medical volumes and their corresponding labels. Estimating the joint distribution implicitly involves the distribution of data, so both labeled and unlabeled data can be utilized in the early stage of training, which alleviates the potential overfitting problem. Besides, GBDL is completely designed under the Bayesian framework, and thus we give its full Bayesian formulation, which lays a theoretical probabilistic foundation for our architecture.

Specifically, an inter-task attention mechanism is presented in LVT, which implicitly absorbs the previous tasks' information and slows down the drift of important attention between previous tasks and the current task. LVT designs a dual-classifier structure that independently injects new representation to avoid catastrophic interference and accumulates the new and previous knowledge in a balanced manner to improve the overall performance. Moreover, we develop a confidence-aware memory update strategy to deepen the impression of the previous tasks.

This is problematic since, for many applications, accurate body shape is as important as pose. The key reason that body shape accuracy lags pose accuracy is the lack of data. While humans can label 2D joints, and these constrain 3D pose, it is not so easy to "label" 3D body shape. Since paired data with images and 3D body shape are rare, we exploit two sources of information: (1) we collect internet images of diverse "fashion" models together with a small set of anthropometric measurements; (2) we collect linguistic shape attributes for a wide range of 3D body meshes and the model images. Taken together, these datasets provide sufficient constraints to infer dense 3D shape. We exploit the anthropometric measurements and linguistic shape attributes in several novel ways to train a neural network, called SHAPY, that regresses 3D human pose and shape from an RGB image. We evaluate SHAPY on public benchmarks, but note that they either lack significant body shape variation, ground-truth shape, or clothing variation. Thus, we collect a new dataset for evaluating 3D human shape estimation, called HBW, containing photos of "Human Bodies in the Wild" for which we have ground-truth 3D body scans. On this new benchmark, SHAPY significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the task of 3D body shape estimation. This is the first demonstration that 3D body shape regression from images can be trained from easy-to-obtain anthropometric measurements and linguistic shape attributes.

To scale up, we derive a new AutoML setting from a platform perspective. In such setting, new datasets sequentially arrive at the platform, where an architecture and hyper-parameter configuration is recommended to train the optimal face detector for each dataset. This, however, brings two major challenges: (1) how to predict the best configuration for any given dataset without touching their raw images due to the privacy concern? and (2) how to continuously improve the AutoML algorithm from previous tasks and offer a better warm-up for future ones? We introduce "HyperFD", a new privacy-preserving online AutoML framework for face detection. At its core part, a novel meta-feature representation of a dataset as well as its learning paradigm is proposed. Thanks to HyperFD, each local task (client) is able to effectively leverage the learning "experience" of previous tasks without uploading raw images to the platform; meanwhile, the meta-feature extractor is continuously learned to better trade off the bias and variance.

In this paper, we propose a self-augmented image dehazing framework, termed D^4 (Dehazing via Decomposing transmission map into Density and Depth) for haze generation and removal. Instead of merely estimating transmission maps or clean content, the proposed framework focuses on exploring scattering coefficient and depth information contained in hazy and clean images. With estimated scene depth, our method is capable of re-rendering hazy images with different thicknesses which further benefits the training of the dehazing network. It is worth noting that the whole training process needs only unpaired hazy and clean images, yet succeeded in recovering the scattering coefficient, depth map and clean content from a single hazy image.

The segmentation loss can then be applied directly to instances and the overall pipeline can be trained in a fully- or weakly supervised manner. We consider the challenging case of positive-unlabeled supervision, where a novel self-supervised consistency loss is introduced for the unlabeled parts of the training data.

Prior work on neural scaling laws suggest that the power-law function can fit the validation performance curve and extrapolate it to larger data set sizes. We find that this does not immediately translate to the more difficult downstream task of estimating the required data set size to meet a target performance. In this work, we consider a broad class of computer vision tasks and systematically investigate a family of functions that generalize the power-law function to allow for better estimation of data requirements. Finally, we show that incorporating a tuned correction factor and collecting over multiple rounds significantly improves the performance of the data estimators.

Specifically, we study a novel generalization problem called unsupervised domain generalization (UDG), which aims to learn generalizable models with unlabeled data and analyze the effects of pre-training on DG. In UDG, models are pretrained with unlabeled data from various source domains before being trained on labeled source data and eventually tested on unseen target domains. Then we propose a method named Domain-Aware Representation LearnING (DARLING) to cope with the significant and misleading heterogeneity within unlabeled pretraining data and severe distribution shifts between source and target data. Surprisingly we observe that DARLING can not only counterbalance the scarcity of labeled data but also further strengthen the generalization ability of models when the labeled data are insufficient. As a pretraining approach, DARLING shows superior or comparable performance compared with ImageNet pretraining protocol even when the available data are unlabeled and of a vastly smaller amount compared to ImageNet, which may shed light on improving generalization with large-scale unlabeled data.}}

In this paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pansharpening called HyperTransformer, in which features of LR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer, respectively.

To alleviate this problem, we propose to introduce the ground plane as a prior in the monocular 3d object detection. The ground plane prior serves as an additional geometric condition to the ill-posed mapping and an extra source in depth estimation. In this way, we can get a more accurate depth estimation from the ground.

Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image + video discriminators pair and design a holistic discriminator that aggregates temporal information by simply concatenating frames' features.

Thus, the category-level modeling can provide complimentary guidance to the temporal dependencies modeling. This paper develops an effective exemplar-consultation mechanism that first measures the similarity between a frame and exemplary frames, and then aggregates exemplary features based on the similarity weights. This is also an efficient mechanism, as both similarity measurement and feature aggregation require limited computations. Based on the exemplar-consultation mechanism, the long-term dependencies can be captured by regarding historical frames as exemplars, while the category-level modeling can be achieved by regarding representative frames from a category as exemplars. Due to the complementarity from the category-level modeling, our method employs a lightweight architecture but achieves new high performance on three benchmarks.

Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of degraded accuracy in posterior approximation, often underperforming the instance-wise variational optimization. Although the latest semi-amortized approaches mitigate the issue by performing a few variational optimization updates starting from the VAE's amortized inference output, they inherently suffer from computational overhead for inference at test time. In this paper, we address the problem in a completely different way by considering a random inference model, where we model the mean and variance functions of the variational posterior as random Gaussian processes (GP). The motivation is that the deviation of the VAE's amortized posterior distribution from the true posterior can be regarded as random noise, which allows us to view the approximation error as uncertainty in posterior approximation that can be dealt with in a principled GP manner. In particular, our model can quantify the difficulty in posterior approximation by a Gaussian variational density. Inference in our GP model is done by a single feed forward pass through the network, significantly faster than semi-amortized methods. We show that our approach attains higher test data likelihood than the state-of-the-arts on several benchmark datasets.}}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic knowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for training in an online manner.

This semantic drift occurs confusion between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the segmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and show that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift problem.

In this paper, we focus on improving the quality of face in the reconstruction and propose a novel Jointly-aligned Implicit Face Function (JIFF) that combines the merits of the implicit function based approach and model based approach. We employ a 3D morphable face model as our shape prior and compute space-aligned 3D features that capture detailed face geometry information. Such space-aligned 3D features are combined with pixel-aligned 2D features to jointly predict an implicit face function for high quality face reconstruction. We further extend our pipeline and introduce a coarse-to-fine architecture to predict high quality texture for our detailed face model. Extensive evaluations have been carried out on public datasets and our proposed JIFF has demonstrated superior performance (both quantitatively and qualitatively) over existing state-of-the-arts.}}

The problem becomes even more pronounced when we have no access to target domain samples for adaptation. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation, where a segmentation model is trained to be domain-invariant without using any target domain data. Existing approaches to tackle this problem standardize data into a unified distribution. We argue that while such a standardization promotes global normalization, the resulting features are not discriminative enough to get clear segmentation boundaries. To enhance separation between categories while simultaneously promoting domain invariance, we propose a framework including two novel modules: Semantic-Aware Normalization (SAN) and Semantic-Aware Whitening (SAW). Specifically, SAN focuses on category-level center alignment between features from different image styles, while SAW enforces distributed alignment for the already center-aligned features. With the help of SAN and SAW, we encourage both intraclass compactness and inter-class separability. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on widely-used datasets (i.e. GTAV, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, Mapillary and BDDS). Our approach shows significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art on various backbone networks. Code is available at https://github.com/leolyj/SAN-SAW}}

Egocentric scene understanding poses unprecedented challenges: (1) due to large head movements, the images are taken from non-canonical viewpoints (i.e., tilted images) where existing models of geometry prediction do not apply; (2) dynamic foreground objects including hands constitute a large proportion of visual scenes. These challenges limit the performance of the existing models learned from large indoor datasets, such as ScanNet and NYUv2, which comprise predominantly upright images of static scenes. We present a multimodal spatial rectifier that stabilizes the egocentric images to a set of reference directions, which allows learning a coherent visual representation. Unlike unimodal spatial rectifier that often produces excessive perspective warp for egocentric images, the multimodal spatial rectifier learns from multiple directions that can minimize the impact of the perspective warp. To learn visual representations of the dynamic foreground objects, we present a new dataset called EDINA (Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities) that comprises more than 500K synchronized RGBD frames and gravity directions. Equipped with the multimodal spatial rectifier and the EDINA dataset, our proposed method on single-view depth and surface normal estimation significantly outperforms the baselines not only on our EDINA dataset, but also on other popular egocentric datasets, such as First Person Hand Action (FPHA) and EPIC-KITCHENS.}}

A common practice is to select the highly confident predictions as the pseudo ground-truth, but it leads to a problem that most pixels may be left unused due to their unreliability. We argue that every pixel matters to the model training. Intuitively, an unreliable prediction may get confused among the top classes (i.e., those with the highest probabilities), however, it should be confident about the pixel not belonging to the remaining classes. Hence, such a pixel can be convincingly treated as a negative sample to those most unlikely categories. Based on this insight, we develop an effective pipeline to make sufficient use of unlabeled data. We first separate reliable and unreliable pixels via the predicted entropy map, then push each unreliable pixel to a category-wise queue that consists of negative samples, and finally train the model with all candidate pixels. Considering the training evolution, where the prediction becomes more and more accurate, we adaptively adjust the threshold for the reliable-unreliable partition. Experimental results on various benchmarks and training settings demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art alternatives.}}
